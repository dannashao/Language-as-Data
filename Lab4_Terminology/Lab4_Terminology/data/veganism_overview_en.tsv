So they were changing their lifestyle. We felt an organization like this was needed,” Chairman H.K. Shah, founder of Vegetarian Vision founded in 1992, now called World Vegan Vision, told News India Times. He and his wife turned vegan 15 years ago. For an Indian vegetarian, to turn to a vegan diet bereft of dairy products, is only to be imagined. But Shah does not think so. “Some people find it hard (without dairy),” he concedes, “But there are so many substitutes today and some of our 2,000 members have been vegan for more than 30 years,” he added. That membership is a far cry from the small group which formed the organization and also included Padma Shri Dr. Sudhir Parikh, chairman of Parikh Worldwide Media and ITV Gold,. The WVV has a membership that has also shifted over time, and now it is spreading its wings to India. On Sept. 9, World Vegan Vision, which opened branches in Mumbai and Delhi just before COVID-19 became a pandemic, hosted a reception to welcome India’s new Consul General in New York Randhir Jaiswal, at Akbar restaurant in New Jersey, a sign of its spreading wings. An interesting factoid is revealed with a search for vegans in America. The American Vegan Society, according to Wikipedia, was founded in 1960, by H. Jay Dinshah in Malaga, New Jersey, when he was just 26 years old, 3 years after he became a vegan. Dinshah married Freya Smith whose parents were active in The Vegan Society of U.K. He remained the president of the organization until 2000 when he died of a heart attack at the age of 66. He brought out a magazine called Ahimsa. As to how many vegans there are today in the U.S., the numbers differ from one study to another. An Ipsos Retail Performance survey in March 2020, estimated there were some 9.6 million Americans on a plant-based diet than there were 15 years ago, Vegannewsnow.com reported March 6, 2020. Livekindly.co referred to a 2004 survey by Time and CNN which found only 290,000 people in this country were interested in a vegan diet. Ipsos used that as its baseline. On the other extreme, Onegreenplanet.org, referring to “recent studies,” claims “30 percent of Americans are not only leaving meat off their plates but also seeking out plant-based meat alternatives,” a claim that could not be verified. The reality may be somewhere in between or even on the lower side. Foodwaysinfocus from Michigan State University, noted that the 2015 book, The Rise of Veganism: Start a Revolution, said only 2.5 percent of the American population is vegan, which however, was still a significant rise from the 1 percent it was in 2009. The Vegan Society, an organization formed back in 1944 in United Kingdom, quotes a 2016 Oxford University study which estimates that if the world went vegan, it could save 8 million human lives by 2050, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and significantly affect climate change positively, not to mention reducing healthcare costs totalling some $1.5 trillion. The Oxford Martin School’s Programme on the Future of Food, built several models, and estimated that if a vegan diet was followed globally, it would cut food-related emissions by 70 percent, compared to 63 percent if everyone went vegetarian, and if ‘global dietary guidelines’ were followed, it would reduce only 29 percent. “Our analysis indicates that adopting global dietary guidelines would not be enough to reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions to the same extent that total greenhouse gas emissions will need to fall to keep global temperature increases to below 2°C,” Dr. Marco Springmann, leader of the study, is quoted saying in the press release from Oxford University. When the U.S.-based Vegetarian Vision was established in 1992, it focused on spreading awareness not only about being vegetarian, but also where such foods could be procured by the new Indian immigrant, hosting events, and securing a following, not just of Indians but also white and black mainstream Americans. “At one time our membership was fifty-fifty Indian and non-Indian,” Shah said. Things have come a long way since then. Today, not only has vegetarianism caught on in Mainstream America, but vegan lifestyles are proliferating. While not statistically proven, it is reasonable to assume that many Americans know someone who is a vegan in their circle of associates and friends, and many who are vegetarians. World Vegan Vision’s overarching message on its website (worldveganvision.org) is, “Let us make the world free of violence and suffering,” and that includes the suffering of a calf whose mother is deprived of the milk meant for her. That is what turned Selina Dhunna, now 24, to the vegan regime when she was just 19 years old, followed by her mother. “The main message is about compassion – not just for humans but also animals and putting yourself in the animal’s position-Why would we drink someone else’s milk that is not meant for us?” Dhunna questions, adding, “Besides, many Indians or other South Asians don’t do too well with milk anyway, with lactose intolerance etc.” According to The Vegan Society, 1 in 5 Brits cut down on meat consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic to date. Certainly, veganism has moved from being seen as a fad to becoming a lifestyle that businesses are also pushing as they see customers lining up behind it.
2020-09-15	10:02:50Z	VegNews		Interest in Veganism Hits All-Time High in 2020, Google Trends Report Shows	https://vegnews.com/2020/9/interest-in-veganism-hits-all-time-high-in-2020-google-trends-report-shows	 September 15, 2020 Interest in veganism has hit an all-time high in 2020, according to a report compiled by food-centric media outlet Chef’s Pencil. Using Google Trends data, the report analyzed the popularity of vegan search terms around the world in a variety of languages. “Data from Google Trends show that the popularity of veganism is at an all-time high, surpassing the prior all-time high registered in 2019,” the report states. “To put things into perspective, veganism is now twice as popular as it was just five years ago, and it doesn’t show any sign of slowing down. Veganism is stronger than ever, as you can see by the number of countries whose cuisine traditionally is greatly meat- and dairy-based seeing a big rise in veganism.” Chef’s Pencil also used Google data to determine the top 15 countries and top 15 cities where veganism is most popular in 2020. The United Kingdom, Australia, and Israel hold the top three spots with the United States coming in near the bottom at 12th place. As for cities, UK’s Bristol overtook Portland, OR as the top city, with Edinburgh coming in third place just above London. Other data supports Chef’s Pencil report that interest in veganism is growing worldwide in 2020, particularly in light of COVID-19. In May, a report—compiled by trade group Plant Based Foods Association and market research company SPINS—found sales of plant-based foods in the US increased by 90 percent during the height of pandemic-buying in mid-March when compared to last year’s sales during that time period, with sales of plant-based meat spiking by 148 percent. Similarly, in a July report, online resource HappyCow found that more vegan restaurants opened than closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Why is giving up meat so popular? When Louis Hunter woke up on the morning of 31 May he didn't know what to do. His hometown of Minneapolis was in disarray after a week of protests following the death of George Floyd, and many businesses - including his own restaurant, Trio Plant-Based - were shut down. "God just touched me and told me to go out and pass out all the food that I had prepared the day before," he told the BBC. In total, Mr Hunter gave away 300 vegan meals and bottles of water to Black Lives Matter protesters. The cause and his restaurant are inextricable in his heart. In 2016 he was facing 20 years in jail on felony rioting charges after participating in a Black Lives Matter protest following the death of his cousin, Philando Castile. Mr Hunter has always maintained his innocence, and charges were eventually dismissed, but he lost his landscaping business and apartment while the sentence hung over his head for over a year. Through his legal battle, he met white activist Sarah Woodcock, who introduced him to the concept of veganism. He started reading about how reducing or eliminating animal products can help reduce the likelihood of developing chronic illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure - illnesses that plague the black community in the US. He says he also started to connect how racial injustice contributes to the poor diet that many African Americans eat. "At first I knew nothing about vegan, plant-based food at all," he said. "After that I started seeing the other ways we were being treated wrongly, as far as our eating habits." Although he does not identify as a vegan, which the Vegan Society defines as an ethical lifestyle choice that eschews all animal products, he says he now eats largely a plant-based diet that consists mainly of vegetables, fruits and legumes. The pair went into business, and after a series of pop-ups, opened Trio in the autumn of 2018. Now he is the sole proprietor, making Trio the first black-owned vegan restaurant in the state. The growth of Trio mirrors national trends, with everyone from athletes to pop stars jumping on board. But nowhere has the vegan diet taken off more than in the African-American community. According to Pew Research Center survey, 8% of black Americans are strict vegans or vegetarians, compared to just 3% of the general of the population. Those findings mirror a 2015 poll by the Vegetarian Resource Group, that found 8% of black people were strictly vegetarian, compared to 3.4% overall. Recently, a January poll by Gallup found that 31% of non-white Americans had reduced their meat consumption in the past year, compared to only 19% of white Americans. The trend is sparking a new generation of vegan influencers, like actress Tabitha Brown, who is getting her own cooking show after her vegan videos blew up on Tik Tok and Instagram (there is even an online petition to make Ms Brown the voice of Apple's Siri). This is one of my favorite vegan bacon substitutes! Good old carrot bacon!!! What’s your favorite bacon substitute?? #tabithabrown #vegan #carrotbacon #plantbased A post shared by Tabitha Brown (@iamtabithabrown) on Apr 12, 2020 at 2:53pm PDT Meanwhile, established celebrities like Beyonce, Lizzo and tennis star Venus Williams have all either gone vegan or tried veganism, with Beyonce even partnering in a "plant-based" meal delivery service. The singer made headlines a few years ago when she promised to give free tickets to her and her husband Jay Z's concerts for life to a fan who made the switch to veganism. So why has veganism become so popular with African-Americans? For many black vegans, their journey begins with a quest for a healthier lifestyle. African Americans have a higher rate of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer than most other groups, in part because their diet is on average higher in salt and fat and lower in fruits and vegetables, research shows. But socioeconomic factors like poverty, living far from a greengrocer and easy access to fast food have made it harder for African Americans to eat healthily, according to the Food Empowerment Project, a non-profit aimed at ending food inequality. Numerous studies have showed that plant-based diets are associated with a lower-risk of developing chronic conditions. The NHS says that a balanced vegan or vegetarian diet can be "very healthy", but notes that it is not the only path to health. It cautioned that vegans need to be careful to plan their diet to get adequate protein and calcium through plant-based sources, and may need to take supplements to guard against B12 and iron deficiencies. One recent study published in the British Medical Journal found that while vegans had a lower rate of heart disease, they had a higher incidence of stroke. Researchers were not sure why, but told the BBC that it could be because of B12 deficiencies. Food quantity, aside from food quality, is also a key factor in maintaining a healthy body weight. Those issues have inspired several black-owned charities, like Compton Vegan, to deliver vegan meals to predominantly black inner-city communities. It's also one of the reasons why Mr Hunter wanted the menu at Trio to focus on foods his community would be familiar with and want to eat, comfort foods like burgers and soul food like collard greens and mac-and-cheese. But those foods don't have to be laden with bacon grease and full-fat cream, Mr Hunter says. The menu at his restaurant Trio veganises many soul food classics, using things like liquid smoke to give collard greens that bacon-y taste and cashews to make mac-and-cheese creamy without the cream. At first, most of his customers were white, but now about half of his business is black. "To nurture my community, is amazing. I pinch myself almost every day to see if it's real," he says. For Omowale Adewale, the founder of Black VegFest, a vegan festival created by and for the black community in New York City, connecting veganism to black culture is essential. But when the festival first debuted, it drew puzzled looks from many white vegans. "The vegan community has been white for so long, and sometimes it feels like they want to keep it white," he says. While the diet has been stereotyped as something exclusively for soy-latte swilling, upper-middle class white hipsters, there is a long history of black veganism in the US and abroad, he is quick to point out. "You love to see yourself represented. That's one of the main reasons why the black community has really galvanised around the vegan idea," he says. While many vegan organisations lobby to improve animal welfare, and Black VegFest is no exception, Mr Adewale also makes sure its platform addresses wider issues in the black community like the fight to end police brutality. After battling high-blood pressure as a young man, Mr Adewale was introduced to vegetarianism by his brother, and then later adopted a vegan diet after being introduced to it by members of the Rastafari religion, which emerged in Jamaica in the 1930s. A central tenet of Rastafarianism is eating "ital" foods - foods that are organic, locally grown and plant-based. Rasta-owned vegan and vegetarian restaurants can be found in cities around the world with a large Caribbean diaspora. Traditional African cuisines, while not strictly vegan, are also largely plant-based and rich in dark leafy greens and legumes - staples in a healthy diet. A recent study involving 48,000 people over 18 years compared the health of meat-eaters, pescatarians - who eat fish and dairy but not meat - and vegetarians, including some vegans. They found that people who eat vegan and vegetarian diets have a lower risk of heart disease, but a higher risk of stroke, possibly partly due to a lack of B12. The vegan movement also has deep roots with the American Civil Rights Movement. Dick Gregory, a famed civil rights activist and comedian who marched alongside Martin Luther King, gave up meat in 1965 and later became a strict vegan. "Because I'm a civil rights activist, I am also an animal rights activist. Animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and vicious taking of life. We shouldn't be a part of it," he said. It was Gregory who introduced Tracye McQuirter to veganism over 30 years ago, when he gave a speech at Amherst College's black student union. Now, Ms McQuirter is one of the many writers and influencers who are helping make veganism mainstream in the black community. Her 2010 cookbook, By Any Greens Necessary, was specifically aimed at black women, and this year she is launching an online campaign to try and get 10,000 black women to go vegan. Ms McQuirter says that veganism is more important now than ever before, as Covid-19 ravages many black communities, in part because of their higher rate of pre-existing chronic conditions. Chronic disease and systemic racism are inextricable, she says. "While the root cause is systemic white supremacy, one of the symptoms is we have access to the unhealthiest foods," she says. As thousands march in Black Lives Matter protests, Ms McQuirter says it is "urgent for us to take care of ourselves and eat well so we have the energy to fight these battles".
2020-09-15	13:08:32Z	Healthline	Lauren Panoff, MPH, RD	Is Beeswax Vegan?	https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-beeswax-vegan	A vegan diet is defined as a way of eating that avoids animal-derived products and ingredients to the best of one’s ability. Veganism typically extends beyond diet and also aims to avoid the use of animal-derived ingredients or byproducts that are harvested in ways that may harm animals. Beeswax is the waxy substance produced by honeybees to construct their hives and contain honey. As honey is often avoided on a vegan diet, you may wonder whether beeswax should also be excluded. This article examines whether beeswax is considered a vegan product and appropriate to include in a vegan lifestyle. Beeswax is a common ingredient in many commercial products, such as food, beverages, cosmetics, candles, and personal care items, including dental floss, lotions, lip balm, and creams, as an emollient, thickener, and emulsifier (1). Produced by secretory glands on the undersides of worker bees, beeswax is the main construction material in the making of a beehive. It’s used by bees to create the honeycomb structure of their hive, as well as serve as caps to contain the bees’ honey (2). When honey is harvested, beeswax must first be scraped off of the beehive. The beeswax can then be melted down for its various commercial uses. Beeswax is a waxy substance produced by worker bees in the construction of hives and containment of honey. It’s used in a number of consumer products. A vegetarian product may be produced by animals or insects but not contain animal flesh itself. For example, vegetarians often consume eggs, honey, and dairy products. By this definition, beeswax can be considered a vegetarian product, as it’s made by bees but doesn’t contain bees themselves. However, determining whether beeswax is vegan requires a further look into the definition of veganism. While some companies harvest beeswax in a way that aims to protect bees from harm, the processes used don’t come without risk of hive disruption, damage, or accidental bee death. Furthermore, some people believe that disturbing animals or their habitats or taking something from them without their direct consent does not align with the principles of veganism. Based on this definition, even if beeswax is removed from hives in a way that avoids harming the bees directly, it’s still removed without their direct consent. Hence, while beeswax can be considered a vegetarian substance, it’s not truly a vegan ingredient. Beeswax does not contain animal or insect flesh and is considered vegetarian. However, there are concerns with how it’s harvested, as well as its effects on the bees, making it not a truly vegan ingredient. Beeswax is a waxy substance made by worker bees to construct hives and contain honey. It’s used in a variety of commercial food and consumer personal care products. While some companies employ beeswax harvesting methods that aim to minimize harm to bees or their hives, the risk of bee death remains. Furthermore, some people on a vegan diet believe that disrupting beehives without the ability to obtain consent from their owners goes against veganism. Therefore, beeswax is considered a vegetarian product, but it’s not vegan. At the end of the day, you have to decide whether the harvesting measures used are enough for you to feel that they align with your ethics. The best way to make this decision is to educate yourself on the practices used by individual companies. 
2020-09-04	07:00:00Z	Green Matters	sophie	Opinion: Miley Cyrus Says She's No Longer Vegan, But Are Ex-Vegans Just Misguided About What Veganism Really Means?	https://www.greenmatters.com/p/miley-cyrus-no-longer-vegan	Miley Cyrus just announced that she is no longer vegan — but I have high hopes that she won't permanently cover up her vegan tattoo just yet. As Cyrus joins the list of celebrities and influencers to denounce the vegan lifestyle in favor of eating animal products for purported health reasons, Cyrus has also dropped quite a few clues that she is still a vegan at heart. And some of my fellow vegans may disagree with me, but I think it is possible to consume animals — for certain reasons — and still "be vegan." Hear me out. As Cyrus explained on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast this week, after seven years of following a plant-based diet, wearing exclusively animal-free fashion, and sharing her vegan values with millions of fans, she no longer identifies as vegan, and is now pescatarian. "I’ve had to introduce fish and omegas into my life because my brain wasn’t functioning properly,” Cyrus said. I'm not here to talk about the health impacts of fish (or "brain types," as Cyrus discusses on the podcast), but for the sake of this article, I'll take Cyrus' claim that she needs to consume fish as the truth — but for the record, humans can easily get omegas from plant foods or supplements, such as algae, flax seeds, and walnuts. (If you want to learn more about that, check out naturopath Dr. Matthew Nagra's response.) Something "ex-vegans" never seem to consider when making the decision to denounce their vegan label is the actual definition of veganism. The Vegan Society defines veganism as "a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose." If Cyrus still holds vegan values and doesn't want to contribute to animal exploitation, but truly believes she needs to eat fish to be healthy, she could still continue to seek to exclude all animal exploitation as far as is possible and practicable. For her, that would look like her continuing to only purchase animal-free clothing, cruelty-free cosmetics, and vegan food — with the exception of fish. And in my opinion, that's a lot more productive than denouncing veganism altogether, which is often a catalyst for letting other animal products back into one's life. Contrary to the stereotype, veganism isn't about being perfect. Most vegans I know do occasionally contribute to animal exploitation — and that doesn't make them any less vegan. I challenge you to find one vegan who has never taken medication containing gelatin, fed meat to a companion animal, purchased a work uniform that contained wool, killed a bed bug, consumed sugar that was filtered through bone char, or something else along those lines. To do those things doesn't make you not vegan, and to do those things doesn't mean you no longer care about animal exploitation. To do those things means you are vegan, even in those moments, because you are still avoiding animal exploitation as much as possible. In fact, in the Joe Rogan interview, Cyrus stated that she still cares about animals multiple times. “I have 22 animals on my farm in Nashville, I’ve got 22 in my house in Calabasas, I’m doing what I need to do for the animals,” she said. She also shared that she cried when she took her first bite of fish after seven years being vegan (fed to her by her then-husband Liam Hemsworth, who also denounced his veganism earlier this year). “I cried, like, for a long time. I cried for the fish," she told Rogan. "It really hurts me to eat fish.” After all, Cyrus once wrote a tearjerker of a song called "Pablow the Blowfish," an ode to her deceased pet blowfish whose death inspired her to go vegan. I find it hard to believe she really stopped caring about the exploitation of fish, or any other animal — and those comments on the podcast make it clear that animals still hold a special place in her heart. Perhaps after taking that bite of fish through tears, she just figured she was no longer a "perfect" vegan, and that she had to shed her vegan label, even though she still holds vegan values. Or, on the contrary, maybe making the decision that her "brain type" requires the consumption of fish (as she implies in the episode, though many have accused that of being misinformation) was just an excuse to convince herself that vegan values are not as important to her as they once were, giving her an excuse to go back to her old ways — which is what happens to so many other vegan celebrities and influencers. We've seen it before: the influencer experiences a health issue, tries a few cures to no avail, tries reintroducing an animal product to her diet, suddenly feels better (very likely a placebo effect), then denounces veganism. For example, last year, YouTuber Bonny Rebecca announced she had added eggs and fish back into her once-vegan diet to remedy health issues in a YouTube video titled "Why I'm no longer vegan…" In the video, she told subscribers she would continue to eat vegan other than those two animal products. But in the following months, Bonny's videos started featuring her casually adding honey to her tea, showing off her new wool rug, and, later, eating chicken sausage — things that seemingly had nothing to do with her health issues, but that she felt she "could" do now that she was "no longer vegan." Publicly declaring they are "no longer vegan" seems to give people of influence free rein to recklessly contribute to animal exploitation once again — and showcase their new lifestyle to their many fans. "F*ck her for spreading misinformation about how vegan Omega 3 works."https://t.co/vcFZ6NDTho But if the vegan community could banish the association between veganism and perfection, maybe these "ex-vegans" would realize it's better to hold onto their vegan values, continue living a vegan lifestyle as far as is possible and practicable, and continue advocating for an end to animal abuse. Basically, instead of using her fish consumption as an excuse to quit veganism, Cyrus could have used the sorrow she felt about eating fish as a catalyst to recommit herself to the vegan lifestyle (even if she will be eating fish while doing so). Because if a vegan starts eating fish for purported health reasons, is it really that different from a vegan taking non-vegan medication? The truth is, we don't know what Cyrus' current lifestyle looks like — if she's also started eating other animal products, buying leather, or wearing makeup tested on animals — but that doesn't really matter. What matters are a person's values, and their attempts to live by those values. If vegan values are still close to Cyrus' heart, she can make the choice to live a vegan lifestyle with the exception of eating fish, but still fight for animal liberation. Because as oxymoronic as that sounds, it's better than not trying at all.

2020-09-13	07:00:00Z	BBC Focus Magazine	By Amy Barrett	Global veganism could undo 16 years’ of fossil fuel emissions	https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/global-veganism-could-undo-16-years-of-fossil-fuel-emissions/	Going vegan could free up 7 million square kilometres of land and remove 16 years’ worth of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. If land currently used to produce meat and dairy was returned to its native ecosystems, it could remove the same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) as was produced by burning fossil fuels over the last 16 years. In a new study published in Nature Sustainability, researchers say that shifting global consumption away from animal products to a more plant-based diet would free up large areas of land. If native vegetation regrowth was encouraged, these areas could add to the fight against climate change by absorbing CO2 in the atmosphere. “Restoring native forests could buy some much-needed time for countries to transition their energy grids to renewable, fossil-free infrastructure,” said Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University and the principal author of the new study. Livestock produce large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 28 times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat. Many who call for meat consumption to be reduced cite their methane emissions, but this new study shows how going meat-free can hugely impact CO2 emissions, too. “We only mapped areas where seeds could disperse naturally, growing and multiplying into dense, biodiverse forests and other ecosystems that work to remove CO2 for us,” said Hayek. “Our results revealed over 7 million square kilometres where forests would be wet enough to regrow and thrive naturally, collectively an area the size of Russia.” In the study, the researchers saw three possible scenarios for 2050: business-as-usual, where meat consumption remains on its current course of increase; a healthier diet with 70 per cent meat reduction; and a vegan diet. If meat consumption follows current economic trends, the business-as-usual diet would see further clearing of ecosystems to make more land space for animal agriculture. Whereas the healthier, reduced-meat diet could remove 332 gigatonnes of CO2 – equal to the amount of CO2 produced over the last nine years by burning fossil fuels. The vegan diet would remove 16 years’ worth of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, a total of 547 gigatonnes. A gigatonne is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 kilograms. However, there are countries on an economic trajectory where it would be challenging to develop economies that weren’t based around livestock, said Hayek. So, the team looked at the opportunities for a reduction in the consumption of animal products across different countries in order to identify which places should be targeted when thinking about restoring ecosystems. “The greatest potential for forest regrowth, and the climate benefits it entails, exists in high- and upper-middle income countries, places where scaling back on land-hungry meat and dairy would have relatively minor impacts on food security,” said Hayek. In quite a lot of ways, I’m afraid. Humans have thrived on the Earth for more than 200,000 years, but we have caused significant environmental damage – threatening the basic resources needed for the survival of our species, including water, air, soil and food. By burning fossil fuels, we’ve sparked a rapid increase in global temperatures, which is predicted to cause a raft of issues from rising sea levels to more intense droughts and heatwaves. Intensive agriculture, deforestation and overfishing have damaged ecosystems and threaten many plant and animal species that we – and other species – rely on. We’ve contaminated our air and water with harmful gases, heavy metals, plastics and other pollutants. A growing population could exacerbate the problem. But all hope is not lost. Tangible solutions to slow or even halt these trends are within our reach. Clean energy sources promise to replace fossil fuels; more sustainable agricultural practices might ensure our planet continues to feed us; and less wasteful consumption could preserve precious resources such as water.

2020-09-12	19:25:35Z	Deccan Herald		Perils of veganism	https://www.deccanherald.com/sunday-herald/sh-top-stories/perils-of-veganism-886405.html	Personalized, Latest & Breaking News No meat, milk or even eggs? What do you eat then?” If you’re a vegan or have vegan friends, these shocking responses will be a common response for you. A lifestyle trend that has grown much in the last decade, skipping milk and animal products for a healthier lifestyle, has found its place among many Indians too. In 2014, there were close to 1.50 lakh vegans across the globe, which rose to 6 lakh in 2019, according to the Global Vegan Society. The vegan revolution has made its impact on several industries, including the production of items like vegan leather and more. While veganism and vegetarianism are often mixed up, they raise health concerns and interesting conversations among foodies and health experts. Christine PK, an IT professional, found veganism as the perfect solution to adopt a cruelty-free lifestyle and reduce weight. “I saw some videos online about how animals were treated to derive products we use in our daily lives and it was enough for me. I had gained a lot of weight because of my constant non-vegetarian food splurging outside earlier. Going vegan was the solution to both these concerns,” she says. Soon enough, she quit and swapped to a plant-based diet and started losing weight. “The results were immediate. Doctors warned me about possible deficiencies, so I consume tofu to replenish my nutrients level now,” she says. Vegans could experience hair fall, mood disorders and are prone to depression, but such symptoms can be handled with care, she adds. Susmitha, who is the co-founder of a vegan restaurant in Bengaluru, was a vegetarian and turned vegan in 2003. The change was far easier for her than she imagined it to be. “While I thought that the number of options would decrease immensely, I discovered more options and learnt how to prepare new things. The real challenge was to explain veganism to people rather than being one,” she says. Her passion for the movement is strong as her restaurant hosts several workshops regularly to assist others in exploring veganism and create new vegan food items. “Creating alternative dishes/items only included understanding what ingredients can be avoided and what can be included. We use local ingredients and make all the milk (from nuts), sauces at our restaurant.” How sustainable is a vegan diet? Pavithra N Raj, chief dietician-nutrition in a Bengaluru hospital, says, “Often vegans have two deficiencies — Vitamin B 12 and D. Many do not substitute for the nutrients available in food items, they avoid consuming milk products etc. Some even avoid wheat.” Soon after, many complain of issues like loose stools, numbness, and inability to walk after getting up. “The only solution becomes Vitamin B12 injections. Calcium and Vitamin D go hand in hand and when calcium-rich food is avoided, then a Vitamin D deficiency is expected.” “Along with food, supplements need to be taken to address the situation. Many supplements also have milk extracts thus one will have to opt for alternates with soya extracts,” she says. Defined as a healthy route, a vegan diet should include ragi, green leafy vegetables for nutrients. “For proteins, one can opt for almond or soya milk, and include sprouts, nuts and dals in the diet.” Keeping aside food habits and choices made because of religious and traditional inclinations, several vilify meat consumption and say it’s not a healthy lifestyle choice. Overindulgence into anything is not good, points out Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, chief clinical dietician in a Bengaluru hospital. “If the production of the meat used antibiotics, it’s unhealthy to consume. If it is prepared with a lot of rich gravy and other accompaniments, then cardiovascular risks are high. When the meat is consumed the right way, it doesn’t create side-effects,” she says. The best way to eat meat would be to steam or grill it so that you don’t add a lot of fat, and then add gravy which is not too calorie-rich,” she believes. Consuming too much meat can be bad for the body. “This could tax your kidneys. Meat should be consumed according to one’s bodyweight requirements: one gm per kg of body weight. Even if you’re an athlete, you don’t need to consume more,” says Dr Priyanka. Of late, consumption of meat has been connected to many gastrointestinal cancers too, which could be another reason to avoid meat. Pork, beef, mutton are considered rich in fat content, thus increasing one’s risk of diabetes, strokes and heart diseases. But, not consuming animal products can lead to a deficiency of nutrients. Nutrition experts suggest that one could opt to be an ‘over vegan’, which means the individual takes a break from the vegan diet and consumes eggs in between. Having been in the F&B industry for three decades, Chef Naren Thimmaiah says that it was important to look at all concerns holistically. He says, “Awareness is key. According to the food cycle, everything should be consumed in a certain way, even among animals. Eating seasonally matters and is a healthy practice that must be followed.” Moderation is also key. “There’s a rage for millets now but consuming it more than required is not the way to go. Educating consumers about such trends is important.” He says while there were people who were practising restraint from animal products even before the vegan movement started, there are also others who have made the switch because of some allergic reactions etc. Naren adds that menus at restaurants now have more options. “There are more quirky vegetable dishes and innovations happening on meats too,” he says. Most movements go through direct and indirect discussions, and literature plays a role in making them more public. For A Moment of Taste, by Poorva Joshipura, looks closely at what happens to animals that are used for animal products, and how all of this is for just a fleeting moment of taste. The book looks at how today’s systems came to be and the state of these industries in India now. Poorva, who is a member of PETA, included her personal observations and tried to prod people to examine their eating habits.

2020-09-15	15:35:54Z	Euronews	Marthe de Ferrer	Live lamb used in provocative new vegan commercial in Israel | Living	https://www.euronews.com/living/2020/09/15/live-lamb-used-in-provocative-new-vegan-commercial-in-israel	The first ever pro-vegan commercial has been broadcast in Israel, making a provocative statement with a live lamb. The advert shows a young couple in a grocery store, looking to buy ‘extra fresh’ lamb from the meat counter. After the woman asks again for the meat to be “extra fresh”, the butcher comes out holding a live lamb, leaving the couple visibly uncomfortable. A voiceover asks viewers to “make the connection” between the meat we eat and the animals it comes from. It also emphasises that over a million people in Israel have “already made the connection”, in a nod to the country’s significant vegetarian and vegan population. The piece was broadcast during one of the nation’s most popular programmes, and is estimated to have reached 3 million people - 35 per cent of Israel’s population. It aired during the season finale of ‘Survivor Israel’, one of the most-watched series in Israeli television history. The commercial was conceived by international charity Vegan Friendly, whose mission is to promote plant-based diets in order to stop animal cruelty and slow down climate change. "The Israeli audience saw on prime time, at the climactic moment of a reality show, the real source of the food it needs," says Omri Paz, founder and CEO of Vegan Friendly. "I want to thank our loyal donor audience that helped us get it on air. The advertisement raises the issue of veganism to the wider public discourse, and even influence many people to make a different choice when they approach the supermarket. "In the presentation of the advertisement, we are also interested in giving support to those who have chosen a vegan lifestyle, so that they will feel represented on the television screen." Israel has been dubbed the ‘world’s vegan capital’ in the past, as it has more vegans per capita than any other country. It was also ranked the third best country on the planet for vegans by Chef’s Pencil. The country’s affinity for vegan cuisine, and the widespread availability of plant-based dishes, is likely related to Judaism’s strict dietary laws for keeping kosher. People who keep kosher have to store meat and dairy separately, both in terms of food preparation and on the plate within meals. “Unique to this newly formed country is the mix of the traditional Mediterranean diet of the area and the strict dietary laws of kosher food – the separation of meat, dairy, and pareve, which is pretty much vegan apart from the fish gelatin and honey, which means it has been easy to embrace veganism,” explains Chef’s Pencil. Research shows how reducing our meat consumption could "drastically" reduce the effects of climate change. 7 salons opting for green, recycled products and using showerheads designed to reduce water. With fears over contaminated poultry on the rise, here are 7 ways you can easily transition to a vegan diet. 
2020-09-14	17:56:38Z	Cherwell Online		Opinion - veganism is not yet fully accessible	https://cherwell.org/2020/09/14/opinion-veganism-is-not-yet-fully-accessible/	Lucy Betts asks why veganism may still be considered a luxury lifestyle, and explores the ways it remains inaccessible for some. What do you envision when you think of a vegan? Do any specific words come to mind? I’ll throw out a few, feel free to disagree: “hipster”, “activist”, “hippy”, “middle class”…”annoying”. This image is out there, publicised, non-controversial and acceptable to routinely spout on TV. Like all groups who attempt to break away from anything previously considered to be social norms, vegans are villainised. They are vigilantes holding ideologies which lie far left of society’s interests but will, ultimately, one day vote Tory. An unbearably high maintenance lifestyle (centring on health, cleansing, spirituality and animal welfare) is the illusion a great deal of people are under. This is problematic, not only for the image of the movement, but for the ecocide environmentalists are desperately attempting to prevent. Creating an aura of exclusivity around a philosophy which can, realistically, only be elevated above the status of a social statement to become genuinely impactful with mass participation, is entirely counter intuitive. Exclusivity is generated through selectively broadcasting a specific image and consumer choice driving faster deployment of more expensive products. Despite this portrayal, veganism is on the rise, with the Vegan Society’s latest research indicating around 600,000 vegans reside in Great Britain. In light of this, a critical question is then brought to the forefront: what makes someone more susceptible to veganism? As with all things remotely political, social class and wealth are inextricably tied in. Citizens of the UK are under the illusion that food security has been achieved. In turn, this indignance to greed and overconsumption threatens a vengeful insecurity. Malnutrition is something that is ignored. The general public have not been galvanised by the Environmental Audit Committee’s latest report, which states that undernourishment is “significant and growing in the UK, with levels among the worst in Europe, especially for children”. Shockingly, in a nation viewed as distinctly developed, people’s diets remain depauperate and their nutrition poor. Members of the general public send their children to school on empty stomachs and ideologies clash amongst the politically inclined who argue for reform. These issues are entirely distinct from those surrounding diet choice; they are issues of food insecurity where individuals are stripped of all choice. They should not be confounded with a reluctance to adopt veganism. There is little ground to stand on when insisting that persistent low income (estimated to be approximately 22% of the UK population) prevents a significant chunk of the public from turning their backs on beef. Only 1.6% of the population identify as vegan. Do the remaining 80% of people considered to be financially stable also feel tofu to be an unjustifiably expensive commodity? Whilst the average middle class shopper might be able to nip into their local Waitrose, it’s a different story for the shopper living in a low income area with 3 hungry (fussy) kids to feed on a budget. Picking up an overpriced vegan ready meal on a busy night is out of the question. Yes, it’s achievable to go vegan on a budget, but people want convenience. They have lives to contend with, personal endeavours to pursue, personal tastes which have already developed. At the end of the day, most people prefer to be left alone to enjoy their 99p cheeseburger in peace and quiet. Planning for a week of vegan meals requires forethought, knowing how to cook in a way your mother or father didn’t (or knowing how to cook at all), adapting your tastes and exiting your comfort zone. As a student this is relatively simple; as a household with a mish-mash of diet preferences, it’s most certainly not. Removing a class divide from a vegan ideology would entail better marketing of vegan options in popular food outlets beyond Holland and Barrett. It would require lower prices of non-threatening vegan foods which don’t take hours to cook and actually taste good (sorry Tesco, your ‘cheese’ is disgusting). Ideally, this would be supplemented by effective education surrounding the food system and the importance of sustainability. I don’t contest that certain groups need to try a whole lot harder than others to cut out meat. I do contest that this is the major driving force preventing radical diet shifts. Paying £2.50 for a pack of Tesco Plant chef Breaded Goujons can really add up when you normally pay only £2.00 for their plain old chicken ones. £2.00 for a kg of lentils on the other hand could make more than enough Dahl to feed a family. At its core, the reluctance to support veganism is rooted in something far more universally entrenched than finances. When delving into the depths of vegan culture, it’s important to assess where the motives for such a radical diet change might stem from. People live in their own bubbles of like-minded companions which are far less accessible than they might like to think. Research conducted by Ofcom concludes that social media users today are less likely than in 2016 to see views they disagree with online. Those who begin to pay attention to where their food comes from, how it’s made and the environmental impacts of its production are likely to find themselves on a downward spiral deep into the depths of YouTube documentaries. This is a fairly niche topic of interest to jump into out of the blue. Even more so when your top video suggestions are ‘Ryan’s Toys Reviews’ and your traditional British family life revolves around a Sunday roast. Being influenced by your social and cultural environment is part of being human. Perhaps, then, it’s not shocking to hear that several studies have resolved that “across Western societies, women are twice as likely as men to be vegan or vegetarian”. Considering the marked prevalence of admired female celebrities who publicly adopt a vegan diet (Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Ellen DeGeneres to name a few), this is a given. It’s hard to be taken seriously in your prolific cult of masculinity trading up a bacon sandwich for hummus and crudites (especially whilst Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson endorses chowing down on a dozen eggs a day). Clearly veganism appeals to a specific demographic. It seems they are in a deadlock, the herbivores and omnivores. They have found themselves in a political war waged through publicity stunts and protesting, supplemented with a healthy dose of social network sparring. Mass media has managed to sculpt a particular perception of veganism, zoning in on a snapshot of the culture. This snapshot captures a minority self-righteous cult of entitled ‘snowflakes’ who like to purchase expensive sustainable fashion on daddy’s credit card. Vegans, instinctively, have sought to fight back. With the popularization of Greta Thunberg, organisations such as Extinction Rebellion being thrust into the limelight and the general growing discomfort surrounding the idea of a climate crisis, the frost towards veganism is starting to thaw. Alongside this thawing, inaccessible logic trapped within the ice has begun leaking out. This logic is making its way gradually into the theatre of fast-food outlets which are now being forced to play ball. Though perhaps not the best way to conserve biodiversity (considering simultaneous attempts to battle an obesity epidemic), it does alleviate issues associated with food accessibility for vegans. As KFC and McDonald’s pioneer in accessible vegan junk food, Greggs flaunt their instantaneously infamous vegan sausage roll. Though responses have been overwhelmingly positive, these new product lines have proven divisive. With one subtle menu addition, the ‘vegan resistance’ was stubbornly declared by Piers Morgan in a tweet against those ‘PC ravaged clowns’ at Greggs. If vegans are not being publicly thwarted, they’re being passive-aggressively ‘integrated’ into society in the most patronizing of ways. Even at the hands of the more ‘nonpartisan’ BBC, the movement is belittled. Vegans are made into caricatures to be humoured in good faith. ‘The Food Chain’ podcast’s newest release “how to date a vegan” has attempted to render abstaining from animal produce devoid of all deeper meaning, presenting vegans as nothing more than fussy eaters. I greatly anticipate their upcoming release, “how to date a feminist”. Continually, society fails to recognise that justifications for going vegan extend far beyond the traditional “meat is murder!” sentiment. Personally, I actively contest this emotional aspect; humanity’s critical downfall in many endeavours is an inability to distinguish between routes which are both moral yet pragmatic, and routes which are selfish but satisfying. This is perhaps why the legal system favours revenge over reform or why Starbucks doesn’t really pay its taxes and no one cares. Veganism being inaccessible boils down to a culmination of misinformation, comfort in conformity and personal problems more immediate than the more ultimate problems the planet faces. Though a share of these problems are indisputably financial, deciding that you aren’t going to participate in institutionalised abuse and environmental destruction is not as simple as a random change of heart. People make it pretty damn difficult. You need to make a concerted effort to get informed. You need to know what you believe and have the strength to stand by it. This takes effort, motivation and a willingness to care. Pivotally, it also takes a collection of like-minded peers, some healthy debate and exposure to certain forms of media beyond your Facebook feed and daytime TV.

Do not use without permission) The top 10 countries where veganism is most popular have been revealed in a new list. Chef's Pencil compiled the list by analyzing Google Trends data, which it describes as a 'reliable source of big data', to search interest level for veganism across the world. It found that searches in the veganism category (including vegan-related searches made in any language) were at an all-time high in 2020. In a statement sent to Plant Based News, Chef's Pencil revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has not stopped the rise of veganism but has 'added fuel to its popularity'. The organization added that searches for vegan recipes have skyrocketed, and continue to go strong - even though lockdown has come to an end in most parts of the world and many restaurants have re-opened. Search data showed that countries whose cuisine traditionally is greatly meat- and dairy-based are seeing a big rise in veganism, said Chef's Pencil, which it concluded means that 'veganism is stronger than ever'. 1.

2020-09-10	07:00:00Z	Daily Trojan Online	MONTANA DENTON	Triple Bottom Line: The meat of the matter	https://dailytrojan.com/2020/09/10/triple-bottom-line-the-meat-of-the-matter/	It’s the second installment of my column and time to jump right into the controversial stuff. It’s time to broach a highly debated, heavily memed subject: veganism. Full disclaimer — I am not and have never been vegan. Throughout college, I’ve gone through phases of experimental vegetarianism, but even when my lactose-intolerant brain screams “no,” I see no reason to turn down a good grilled cheese or a slice of pizza. While my admittedly short, albeit dedicated vegetarian experience is over (for now), my eating habits have definitely changed. I find myself naturally gravitating toward more plant-based foods instead of meat-heavy meals. A few years ago, I would never have believed that a veggie California burrito just hits different than the classic carne asada (pro tip –– it absolutely does). While vegetarianism and veganism are growing in popularity, being a conscientious grocery consumer is a privilege, not a right. While society is more accommodating of dietary restrictions than ever, it can still be costly to maintain a balanced and nutritious vegan diet. Many advocates of veganism claim that staples such as pasta, rice, tofu, beans and lentils are cheaper than their animal-product counterparts. You’ll undoubtedly save money not buying meat –– it’s estimated that one fillet of chicken breast is $5 per pound and has about 24 grams of protein per serving, but a can of black beans typically costs around a dollar for the same amount of protein. The math is simple –– per year, plant-based consumers can save a significant amount of money. However, vegan diets do require dedication. Buying more fresh produce is great for your body, but comparatively, it goes bad much faster than frozen foods or pantry sundries, meaning more quick trips to the grocery store are needed to restock. Many vegans also develop nutritional deficiencies because they commonly lack vitamin B12 and vitamin D3, nutrients that are found almost exclusively in animal-sourced foods and are crucial for nerve and brain function. While being vegan can be affordable, this doesn’t offset the fact that some degree of budgetary flexibility is needed to successfully maintain a plant-based diet. It is achievable, but not for all. Kids who are part of school-free and reduced-lunch programs don’t have the luxury of rejecting what is put on their plate. In food deserts like South Central, it can be more difficult (although not impossible) to access a consistent assortment of fresh produce. Getting the most food for your dollar means that many aren’t necessarily focused on the nutritional quality of what they’re purchasing –– they’re just trying to make sure their family doesn’t go hungry. Processed foods often have a longer shelf life and are more readily available than fresh fruits, vegetables and pricey vegan-certified and meat-substitute products. For those that qualify for the United States Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, it can be extremely hard to align the goals of both healthy and affordable eating. The federal program, often referred to as SNAP, is essentially a food-stamp benefit program designed to “supplement the food budget of needy families so they can purchase healthy food.” While its goal is admirable, it’s also extremely vague. There is an educational component of the program that teaches SNAP beneficiaries about the best methods of buying cheap, nutritious foods and leading healthy lives. However, the number of stores that accept SNAP is limited, and beneficiaries are more focused on their primary goal of alleviating hunger than choosing the most nutritious options. Additionally, the maximum monthly SNAP allotment for a family of four is $649, coming out to $36 a person per week, leaving little room for error or experimentation when shopping for the bare essentials. Many ways to improve the program and enhance its nutritional impact have been suggested, including increasing the number of places that accept SNAP benefits, expanding to more farmers markets and offering cash incentives to purchase and further subsidize the cost of fresh produce. To fully commit to and execute their goal of achieving healthy lifestyles for all, the process of food accessibility as a whole needs to change. No one sells the vegan lifestyle like a newly converted vegan. There’s no shortage of celebrities, professional athletes and influencers who are strong proponents of a plant-based diet. Colorful photos of carefully prepared fruits, veggies and grains flood Instagram health accounts, reinforcing the message that veganism is healthy, easy and enjoyable. While these fit, glowing and healthy individuals make veganism look fun and simple, it’s important to consider the divide between Instagram and reality. Even for the everyday herbivore, dedication, time and research are needed to ensure you are getting all of the supplements and nutrients needed for a healthy diet. A few years ago, LeBron James made headlines for following an extremely strict paleo diet –– cutting out sugar, carbs and dairy entirely and subsisting solely on meat, fish, fruits and vegetables –– and losing a drastic amount of weight. The reason LeBron was so successful? He had resources that the average health-conscious consumer does not — private trainers, nutritionists and chefs to provide him with the knowledge and nutrients needed to conduct a drastic diet change and still maintain his superhuman fitness and athleticism. In most instances, it can be extremely unhealthy and unsafe to cut entire food groups out of your diet. Those with underlying health issues, allergies and dietary restrictions and those recovering from eating disorders may not necessarily benefit from a restrictive diet like veganism. All this is not to say that being vegan can’t be a healthy, family-friendly diet, but there are several crucial caveats to consider when contemplating a switch to veganism. Having the ability to make choices about what you eat is a privilege in itself. Veganism can be an affordable, eco-friendly and ethical switch –– if you have the resources to do so.

2020-09-03	18:28:18Z	The Beet	smcclain	Miley Cyrus, Formerly Vegan, Admits She Now Eats Fish	https://thebeet.com/miley-cyrus-formerly-vegan-admits-she-now-eats-fish/	In a recent interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, Miley Cyrus revealed that she has officially forsaken the title of vegan, and in 2019 added fish to her diet, and now considers herself pescetarian. An article today on Plant-Based News took a deep dive into the podcast episode that Rogan hosted with the superstar, who said that she ditched veganism after it impeded her brain function. ‘I was vegan for a very long time and I’ve had to introduce fish and omegas into my life because my brain wasn’t functioning properly,’ Cyrus remarked, referring to Omega-3's which are present in fish but can also be found in vegan foods like walnuts, edamame, soybean oil, kidney beans and seeds like chia, hemp and flax. Cyrus was reintroduced to fish after her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth, another former vegan, barbequed her some on their grill in 2019. "Now I’m so much sharper than I was and I think that I was at one point pretty malnutrition," says Cyrus, who is known as an outspoken advocate for animals. After Rogan warned that her vegan fans were going to be upset, the 27-year-old defended her new diet, saying, "Listen, I give home, I have 22 animals on my farm in Nashville, I've got 22 in my house in Calabasas like I'm doing what I need to do for the animals, okay? But when it comes to my brain - you're not vegan, you can't be vegan and living this kind and being this quick, but sure you can, some people can, I cannot." Scientific evidence seems to refute Cyrus' claims of improved brain function after ditching a vegan diet. A study that followed nearly one thousand participants for five years assessing their brain function and concluded that a diet heaviest in leafy greens was most brain-healthy. A vegan diet rich in whole foods would fit the bill. Dr. Matthew Nagra, ND, took to Instagram to comment on Cyrus' recent transition back into eating some animal product, suggesting that a placebo effect may have caused the star to feel improved cognitive function, "Something that should give pause is when someone notices drastic improvements with a small dietary change. This screams placebo effect. On a physiological level, it’s impossible for a few meals of seafood to drastically change omega-3 levels, especially within the brain." "This becomes even more likely when a vegan has constantly been told that their diet is deficient by those who clearly have not seen the data. We can start to believe it…That being said, we have no clue what Miley was actually eating." What do you think about Cyrus' recent departure from veganism? Let us know in the comments below. 
2020-09-09	11:05:25Z	Plant Based News	Louisa Kendal at Viva!	As Stars Ditch Veganism - Does Celebrity Culture Hinder The Vegan Movement?	https://www.plantbasednews.org/opinion/celebrity-culture-hinder-vegan-movement	Does celebrity culture hurt the vegan movement? Miley Cyrus is the latest celebrity to step down from the vegan movement. According to Cyrus, she had to incorporate fish into her diet because her brain wasn’t functioning properly. Well, she is half right. If she wasn’t getting her omega 3s through either algae supplements (where the fish themselves get it from) or a balanced vegan diet, her brain health would have been suffering. But, it takes just a few minutes of googling to find out that an algae oil supplement or regular intake of certain nuts and seeds (especially walnuts and flaxseeds) would have provided her with far healthier sources of omega 3 than fish. Since Cyrus’ announcement, my social media feed has been full of vegans expressing their disappointment in such a high profile vegan giving up. The tabloids have been jumping on the bandwagon with snarky comments about malnutrition, and even my friendship group (where vegans are very much the minority) are discussing how it was bound to happen if you ‘restrict your diet so much.’ And this right here is the problem. The spotlight has turned away from the victims - the animals trapped in horrific farms before they’re shipped off to a brutal death - to one extremely privileged person who couldn’t be bothered to do their research. 'It’s time we stop glorifying those that stand in the spotlight and focus on those trapped in the dark, barren sheds instead' Committed animal advocates have continued to stand on high streets showing people factory farm footage, having difficult conversations, educating their friends and family on vegan alternatives and fighting for a better world. But thanks to our toxic attitude towards celebrities, Cyrus’s decision to eat fish is the story that’s stolen the headlines. Society is slowly moving closer to understanding that eating animals is inherently wrong, but all that work is undone when we allow ourselves to put people on pedestals and take their word as gospel. The vegan movement is about ending animal oppression. But when we allow some humans to have more importance than others, how can we ever expect people to value human and non-human animals equally? Celebrities sell their lifestyle as their brand, but veganism is so much more than this. It’s time we stop glorifying those that stand in the spotlight and focus on those trapped in the dark, barren sheds instead. This article was originally published by Viva!. Louisa is the digital communications officer at leading animal protection charity Viva!. She has been vegan for four years and is passionate about eradicating injustices and exploitation in our world.
2020-09-14	10:55:34Z	Plant Based News	Maria Chiorando	Ex-Vegan Miley Cyrus Says It's 'Over The Top' To Be Invested In Other People's Diets	https://www.plantbasednews.org/news/ex-vegan-miley-cyrus-over-the-top-invested-other-peoples-diets	Ex-vegan Miley Cyrus says it is 'over the top' for vegans to be 'so invested in other people's diets'. The celebrity recently revealed that she has ditched her vegan diet and now eats fish while appearing on a recent episode of Joe Rogan's podcast. The star, who has since been blasted for spreading misinformation, said she needed to eat fish as her 'brain wasn't functioning properly', and is now 'eating for her brain type'. Responding to Cyrus' revelations, Rogan said the vegans 'would come for her' after admitting she now eats animals, and the singer replied that they will come for her, but it's ok, as she is 'used to people coming for me'. She added: "Listen, I give home, I have 22 animals on my farm in Nashville, I've got 22 in my house in Calabasas, like I'm doing what I need to do for the animals, okay? But when it comes to my brain - you're not vegan, you can't be vegan and living this kind and being this quick, but sure you can, some people can, I cannot [sic]." Rogan asked what veganism did to her brain, and Cyrus replied: "Now I'm so much sharper than I was and I think that I was at one point pretty malnutritioned [sic]." Now Cyrus has discussed the situation further during this morning's edition of the Edge morning show, as reported by NewsHub. The singer said she was 'expecting some backlash from the vegan community'. "When I was vegan I was really worried about other people's diets and really judgey... it's a little over the top to be so invested in other people's diets," she said. "If I was feeling at my best... and could learn how to live at a 110 percent living a vegan lifestyle I would have done... I just didn't get there." Despite Cyrus' claims about a vegan diet and brain function, ND Dr. Matthew Nagra has spoken out about how 'fatigue (mental or physical) can be caused by a myriad of issues, which may not be diet-related, and there’s no indication that she was seeking any medical care'. "In addition, it’s important to note that the research on omega-3 supplements (EPA/DHA) and cognitive function is mixed, with potential benefit in older adults specifically. Of course, fish is a source of these omega-3s, but so is a vegan algae-based supplement," he wrote in an Instagram post. "That being said, it is unclear if vegans even need to supplement since we produce EPA and DHA from short-chain omega-3s (ALA) in foods like flax and our levels don’t vary much from fish eaters. Furthermore, those with genetically elevated levels don’t seem to be protected against Alzheimer’s disease, which is why I just think of these supplements as an extra safety measure, to ensure you get enough." He added: "Something that should give pause is when someone notices drastic improvements with a small dietary change. This SCREAMS placebo effect. On a physiological level, it’s impossible for a few meals of seafood to drastically change omega-3 levels, especially within the brain. "This becomes even more likely when a vegan has constantly been told that their diet is deficient by those who clearly have not seen the data. We can start to believe it…That being said, we have no clue what Miley was actually eating. "So before you see all the carnivore doctors posting about this negative anecdote, even though meat is a poor source of omega-3s, remember that an anecdote isn’t science and the overwhelming body of evidence suggests that vegans/vegetarians have lower risk of many non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. There’s a reason that health professionals like @drgarthdavis and @brendadavisrd continue to thrive without any signs of slowing down." Maria is the editor of Plant Based News.

From left are Jackie Hunsaker, Cori Bettis, Teddi Bettis, 10, Wesley Bettis, 12, Khloe Perez, 12, and Jaynee Perez. Tuesday, Sept. 15, 2020 | 2 a.m. When Dale Darcas’ daughter was 8 years old, she took the money from her piggy bank and asked him to take her to the store to buy school supplies for children who didn’t have any. Darcas couldn’t help thinking of his childhood in that moment. He was one of four kids raised by a single mother and remembered how holiday gifts would not have been possible without Toys for Tots. “That just hit my heart thinking that as individuals we can maybe be a paycheck away from being in that situation,” Darcas said. Darcas is the executive director of Serving Our Kids, a nonprofit that provides bags of food for 3,800 students at 80 Southern Nevada schools to take home on the weekends. The group started 14 years ago serving 20 students at one school. “We asked the question to the counselors, other than back-to-school supplies, what’s the biggest need for children in schools. They said food for the weekend,” Darcas said. About 67% of students qualify for free and reduced lunches in the Clark County School District, and during the pandemic, all students get two meals daily through U.S. Department of Agriculture waivers. But what happens when schools are closed on the weekend? Three Square, the largest community food bank in the Las Vegas area, also provides weekend meal bags. But not all children qualify, which is where Serving Our Kids fills the void, Darcas said. School counselors identify and refer students who need food for the weekend. In the first week of the 2020-21 school year, there was a 27% increase in referrals from school counselors, as the pandemic has brought an economic crisis to the area. Darcas said there are 15,000 homeless and at-risk children in the area. “The need is much greater than it’s ever been,” he said. To meet the need, the group has constantly moved to bigger spaces, now at a warehouse in Henderson — their 11th location in 14 years. The initial five years were spent renting a storage unit and holding food drives in a grocery-store parking lot. The weekend bag includes: two packets of oatmeal, ravioli, ramen noodles, granola bars, crackers and fruit juice. “We put two oatmeal packets in the bags for the kids so that they have breakfast for Saturday and Sunday morning and then we put ravioli and a ramen noodle (package) so that they have lunch for Saturday and Sunday. And then we put other snacks in the bag as well like crackers and fruit juice and applesauce, granola bars,” Darcas said. Every Thursday, volunteers bag meals that will be delivered to schools for the weekend. During the pandemic, a delivery driver parks across the street from the school so children can pick up their meal bags. They typically run out of food every two weeks, leaning on more than 200 community partners to continuing to raise awareness and restock their shelves. SOS Radio, Equity Title Co. and Sunland Asphalt & Construction put on annual food drives, and Tabbert Team mortgage lenders donates a percentage of proceeds on each home loan, Darcas said. In March, Andre Agassi Foundation for Education donated $20,000, and Haas Automation has donated $25,000. “Everybody has a story of how they find Serving Our Kids. It’s one of the biggest blessings to me,” said Ken Ravago, a volunteer driver with the group. Schools are also pitching in with food drives, including Shirley & Bill Wallin, Frank Lamping, Glen Taylor and John C. Vanderburg elementary schools. At Wallin, teacher Jaynee Perez brought students to their group’s facility to help bag the food. “I wanted the kids to get the full picture,” Perez said. “Because when you donate it, all you know is you’re bringing it to donate and somebody’s picking it up. You don’t see what happens. It makes an impact.” The next food drive is Oct. 10 at the warehouse, 121 Industrial Park Road in Henderson.
2020-08-22	07:00:00Z	Euronews	Marthe de Ferrer	Plant-based athlete: Atlético Madrid’s Saúl explains why he isn't vegan yet	https://www.euronews.com/living/2020/08/22/plant-based-athlete-atletico-madrid-s-saul-explains-why-he-isn-t-vegan-yet	As athletes often rely on a protein-heavy diet, the myth that high-level sportspeople need to consume animal products to succeed has persisted for decades. But, since the release of The Game Changers two years ago, the conversation around veganism and elite sport has begun to evolve. At 25, Atlético Madrid’s Saúl Ñíguez is already one of the best midfielders in Europe - if not the world - with a host of senior caps for Spain also under his belt. What you may not know is that the Spaniard follows an entirely plant-based diet to fuel his training. But Saúl doesn’t refer to himself as a vegan yet, as he considers veganism to be about far more than just food - “it is a lifestyle,” he tells Euronews Living. Having not eaten meat in a while, he used lockdown as a chance to stop eating eggs and move away from animal products entirely. “The truth is that it hasn’t been difficult for me,” Saúl explains, “because I’ve done it through a slow process, and always doing it in a way controlled by a nutritionist.” Now following a fully plant-based diet, the footballer is keen to dispel the belief that athletes need meat and animal products to succeed. I ask Saúl what he thinks about this old-fashioned notion. “Well,” he laughs, “it is a belief. It is a wrong belief, though. When you are vegan the only vitamin you lack, which is very important and mandatory to take, is B12. The people who talk about these issues are people who have not been well-informed.” The initial decision to become vegetarian was fuelled by a serious health issue. During his Champions League debut in February 2015, shortly before half-time, Saúl went for the ball at the same time as Kyriakos Papadopoulos (then playing for Bayer Leverkusen). The two clashed, and the Spaniard fell to the turf in excruciating pain. He was rushed to hospital with a “destroyed” kidney, in the words of Atlético’s president at the time. It was this injury which eventually led Saúl to forgo meat entirely. “The nutritionist recommended that the best thing for my kidney is to be a vegetarian,” he says. “The left kidney was overworking to process proteins.” Now, fully recovered, Saúl’s training schedule is fairly full-on - much as you would expect from a top footballer. Focusing on heavier sessions in the first half of the week, the second half is then structured around tapering for weekend matches. His diet, therefore, needs to contain all the essential proteins for muscle recovery, along with enough calories to maintain energy levels throughout the week. “A typical breakfast for me is toast with avocado and tomato - with the best, healthiest bread,” says Saúl outlining a typical day of meals. “I finish training and eat fruit - lots of fruit after training! Usually bananas and kiwis, or if training is lighter then I eat a little more variety, such as mango or grapes.” Along with snacks throughout the day, Saúl’s dinners are predominantly divided neatly into carbohydrates, proteins and fats - to ensure the right balance of nutrients. “It’s always usually half a plate of vegetables, or more,” he jokes, “but with a good structure.” Curry is always a firm favourite for the 25-year-old, largely because of its versatility. He usually adds chickpeas and vegetables for balance. He’s also a big supporter of Spanish food start-upHeura, which makes regular appearances on Saúl’s Instagram stories, as he whips up the vegan meat substitute into an array of dishes. A post shared by Heura® Foods (@heurafoods) on Aug 9, 2020 at 1:15am PDT “What I like the most about vegan recipes are the desserts though. The desserts seem spectacular to me that they are healthy and I can eat them,” he adds with a laugh. I ask Saúl what his teammates think of his plant-based diet, particularly as I spot Heura cropping up on other players’ social media channels too. “My colleagues are surprised, it’s something new for them,” he explains. “The truth is that many follow my diet because it grabs their attention, and then they eat my food - and they feel good eating my food! “In the end, trying it once doesn’t change anything, but when you have been eating vegan and healthy for two weeks it changes your life a lot. You sleep better, you are less bloated, when you are competing you recover more quickly - I think it is very beneficial for everyone.” Saúl is keen to highlight though, that a vegan diet isn’t automatically healthy. People can’t just ditch animal products and assume their food is good - in order to feel the true benefits, a plant-based diet needs to be holistic, balanced, and genuinely healthy. He’s recently shown his commitment to promoting positive, healthy lifestyles by establishing Club Costa City with his brother Aaron, who plays for Malaga. The pair teased the club’s creation back in June - briefly sending Manchester United fans into a tailspin, as people leapt to the conclusion that Saúl would be transferring to Old Trafford. A post shared by Saul Ñiguez (@saulniguez) on Jul 27, 2020 at 4:08am PDT In fact, the brothers established a grassroots football project in their hometown of Elche, “with the aim of generating healthy habits,” Saúl told AS at the time. As we discuss veganism and its rise in popularity in sport, particularly after The Game Changers, Saúl raises an issue with the terminology. “Being plant-based or vegetarian doesn’t mean vegan, there is a huge difference. One, so to speak, is a diet. Being vegan is much, much more,” he says. “It is a lifestyle, in which you cannot wear certain types of clothing, certain cosmetics. It is a lifestyle that is all about protection and ensuring that animals are not mistreated in any way. It’s a lifestyle that I’m not personally involved in yet, but I am step-by-step becoming vegan. I’m not vegan yet though. A post shared by Saul Ñiguez (@saulniguez) on Dec 25, 2019 at 6:52am PST “I’m a strict vegetarian. I don’t eat anything which comes from animals, but that’s separate from the lifestyle of veganism.” It’s clear that, for Saúl, this is a journey; shunning eggs, dairy and meat aren’t enough for him to call himself a vegan. Instead, he wants to move towards the holistic meaning of veganism, but he recognises he isn’t there yet. One of the criticisms often levelled at high-profile celebrities on plant-based diets is that this lifestyle is only afforded to the wealthy and privileged. Particularly as athletes - professional or otherwise - need to ensure their meals are balanced and appropriate, surely working with a nutritionist is essential? Does this, therefore, mean that only the wealthy can afford to do sport while plant-based? “It is true that having a nutritionist is not cheap,” says Saúl, but for him a nutritionist is an essential part of his training routine, “I live by and for my body, so I think it is necessary for me.” But, while he does recommend following a nutritionist’s advice where possible, he doesn’t agree that it is an essential part of leaving animal products behind. “I think it would be a good investment for a person, but it’s not necessary.” Who doesn't love a picture of animals doing human things? Diversity within cycling can be a ‘powerful tool for change.’ The best eco-imagery from around the world this week, gathered by Euronews Living.

2020-09-05	07:00:00Z	Grit Daily		If Veganism Isn’t In The Cards, Here Are Some Other Things You Can Do To Help	https://gritdaily.com/if-veganism-isnt-in-the-cards-here-are-some-other-things-you-can-do-to-help/	Veganism isn’t necessarily for everyone. Although there are definite environmental benefits, there are also all kinds of completely valid reasons to not follow a vegan diet. For one, not everyone can do it for health reasons. Vegan food also isn’t accessible to all people in all areas. In some communities, it can be very difficult if not impossible to find vegan options. Not to mention the various cultural and financial reasons a vegan diet might not work for your lifestyle. If it does, that’s great! But the good news is, if veganism just doesn’t work for you, there are several other ways you can make little lifestyle changes to help protect the environment and the animals that live in it. One really fun way to promote veganism without changing diet is by shifting your beauty routine to vegan and cruelty-free products. This is a super easy lifestyle change to make, and there are all sorts of resources out there to help. There are more vegan products out there than you might think, and they’re available in all price ranges. Products can be vegan and cruelty-free without sacrificing quality at all. A vast majority of my makeup and skincare products are now vegan. Not only does it feel more healthy and natural, but I can sleep easy knowing that no animals were harmed so my skin can look nice. Speaking of looking good, sustainable shopping is another great way to support a healthy environment. Fashion is a huge source of waste in the environment, and shopping responsibly with the planet in mind can make a huge difference. When it comes to wardrobe updates that don’t create tons of waste, there are tons of great sustainable brands out there. Even better, buy clothing secondhand. Shopping at thrift stores is a great way to recycle and find super cute and unique pieces for less. This kind of shopping is a more ethical way to stay fashionable without damaging the planet. When it comes to fashion, stay away from leather and fur if you can. In 2020, there are such amazing and authentic vegan alternatives. I have a faux fur coat that I swear is softer than the real thing. I’ve never had a real fur coat, but I’m sure the faux is just as good. The same goes for vegan leather. Technology has come so far that there are soft, buttery vegan leather jackets that have all the style with none of the guilt. There’s a lot of plastic out there, and getting away from it entirely is a huge task. That doesn’t mean that all hope is lost. Moving away from plastics wherever possible is a great way to help protect the environment. Cutting down on paper products and saving trees is also a great thing to do. One of the easiest ways I’ve chosen to cut down on both paper and plastic is by replacing my cleaning products with more sustainable options. Instead of using paper towels, I use washable microfiber cloths. I recently made the choice to switch from sponges, which aren’t recyclable, made of plastic, and need to be replaced often, with Tawashi vegetable brushes on the recommendation of @acleanbee, a sustainable cleaning influencer. Yes, that’s a thing, and yes, it’s just as amazing as it sounds. Another great way to move away from plastic and waste is by reusing containers. Instead of buying Tupperware, save jars from things like jam and pickles and use those instead. When your candles reach the bottom, clean them out and use them to store household items. Repurposing household items is both a fun craft project and a great way to help the planet. A full transition to veganism might not be possible, but if you can, doing one night a week of meatless meals is a great way to cut down on consumption. Even cutting down on meat and dairy consumption just a little bit makes a dent in the environmental impact. It’s less daunting then a full-blown switch to veganism, but it still makes a difference. Whether you follow a full vegan diet or not, these are great ways to supplement and create a healthier environment, for our animals and ourselves. Olivia Smith is an Editor-at-Large at Grit Daily.

Do not use without permission) A new list has revealed the top 10 cities where veganism is most popular. The list was compiled by Chef's Pencil, which analyzed Google Trends data (describing it as a 'reliable source of big data') and searches for interest levels for veganism across the world. It found that in 2020, searches in the veganism category (including vegan-related searches made in any language) were at an all-time high in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has not stopped the rise of veganism but has 'added fuel to its popularity', Chef's Pencil said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. While lockdown has come to an end in most parts of the world and many restaurants have re-opened, searches for vegan recipes have skyrocketed, and continue to go strong. Search data showed that countries and cities whose cuisine traditionally is greatly meat- and dairy-based are seeing a big rise in veganism, said Chef's Pencil, which it concluded means that 'veganism is stronger than ever'. 1.

2020-08-25	13:55:13Z	The Beet	hwelch	What You Can Learn From 20 Athletes Who Went Vegan to Get Stronger	https://thebeet.com/what-you-can-learn-from-20-athletes-who-went-vegan-to-get-stronger/	Now more than ever, athletes are reaching for lentils, edamame, and chickpeas instead of biting into steak dinner, to raise their strength, fitness, and overall performance levels. Here are twenty athletes who credit switching to a vegan or plant-based diet with improving their fitness and results-- through faster recovery time between workouts, quicker healing from injury, and being able to build leaner, stronger muscles. These superstars say that their diets helped them get to where they are today, such as preparing for Olympic Gold or becoming the number one tennis player in the world. These champion players report that eating a plant-based diet increases energy levels, provides more than enough clean protein to refuel and rebuild, reduces inflammation, and improves recovery time. Eating plant-based also helps them with mental clarity, and even abates allergy symptoms like asthma during the most intense allergy season. In the nearly one year since The Game Changers was released last September and became one of the most-watched documentaries, and showed that some of the world's strongest and accomplished athletes don't need meat or dairy to succeed, more and more players are limiting their animal protein intake and are going all or mostly plant-based. The number one tennis player in the world, Novak Djokovic, went plant-based more than twelve years ago to enhance his athletic performance and win more matches. In recent interviews, he has credited going vegan with helping him rise from third place in the world to first in the world because it helped clear his allergies. Before changing his diet, Djokovic had searched for cures to the breathing issues that cost him matches and focus which caused him to struggled during his most intense matches. The allergies used to make him feel like he couldn’t breathe and would be forced to retire from competitive matches as he did in Australia. "Eating meat was hard on my digestion and that took a lot of essential energy that I need for my focus, for recovery, for the next training session, and for the next match," he said. Djokovic emphasized he does not eat foods that require a lot of digestion, especially in the morning, when he needs all of his energy for training. Instead, he starts the day with hot water and lemon, then celery juice, and some superfood supplements. Tia Blanco won gold at the International Surfing Association Open in 2015 and credits her success to her vegan diet. Blanco reports that a vegan diet helps her stay strong and she enjoys eating different forms of vegan protein like nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes. The professional surfer was influenced by her mother, who is a vegetarian and grew up in a veggie-forward household, Blanco has never eaten meat in her life, which made the plant-based switch much easier. And speaking of making things easier, Blanco has an Instagram cooking page called @tiasvegankitchen where she shares her favorite simple vegan recipes so all of her fans can eat like their favorite professional vegan athlete. In addition to her home-cooked meals, Blanco recently became an ambassador for vegan company Beyond Meat and now she posts Instagram stories and highlights of her favorite meatless meat recipes. Steph Davis has been vegan for 18 years now and says, "there’s nothing in my life that hasn’t become better as a result, from climbing and athletics to mental and spiritual well being." Davis has competed on some of the most challenging verticle routes on the planet –like Concepcion (5.13), which is known to be one of the hardest pure climbs anywhere. Davis holds the third overall ascent and is the first female to ever make the ascent of the route. Davis described it as her "most technically demanding climb ever." Davis explained why she went vegan eight years ago when she partnered with PETA. "What can we do to start making changes in a positive way? And if it just so happens that changing our lifestyle leads to environmental benefits, health benefits, economic benefits, and positive social change, then all the better. One thing I’ve learned is you don’t have to do or be anything you don’t want to be, and you can change anything in your life just by starting to do it. It’s you who chooses who and what you are, by the things you think and the things you do." She goes on to add, "no one says you have to become a “perfect” vegan overnight. But why not start making small changes and see how it feels? I believe it’s the small choices people make that have the biggest power to change, and nothing is more simple yet also more far-reaching than changing how and what you choose to eat. We’re all here for a short time, in the end, and living a well-intentioned and compassionate life seems like what ultimately matters the most, the only real goal that I aspire to." Tennis champion Venus Williams swears that making the switch to veganism was one of the factors that helped to improve her performance and get over an auto-immune disease. The tennis star went vegan back in 2011 when she was diagnosed with Sjögren's syndrome, a debilitating autoimmune disease with a range of symptoms from joint pain to swelling, numbness, burning eyes, digestive problems, and fatigue. She chose to eat plant-based to recover to her formerly healthy self, and it worked so she stuck to it. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion recovers faster on a plant-based diet now, compared to how she felt back when she ate animal protein. When you have an auto-immune disease you often feel extreme fatigue and random body aches and for Venus, a plant-based diet provides energy and helps her reduce inflammation. The Beet reported on Willaim's diet and what she normally eats in a day to stay healthy, fit, and win more matches. Talking about her favorite dinner meal, Williams adds, “sometimes a girl just needs a donut!" Mike Tyson recently said he is "in the best shape ever" thanks to his vegan diet. The boxing legend then announced he's getting back into the rings after 15 years, to fight against Roy Jones, Jr. in California later this fall. Tyson went vegan ten years ago after dealing with health complications and in the wake of having cleaned up his life: “I was so congested from all the drugs and bad cocaine, I could hardly breathe." Tyson said, “I had high blood pressure, was almost dying, and had arthritis." Now, the 53-year-old powerhouse is sober, healthy, and fit. "Turning vegan helped me eliminate all those problems in my life,” and "I'm in the best shape ever." His new trainer agrees: Watching Iron Mike's speed during recent training sessions, observed: "He has the same power as a guy who is 21, 22-years old." Oklahoma City's point guard Chris Paul decided to ditch meat and dairy and was asked join on as a co-executive producer for the popular documentary, The Game Changers. For breakfast, Paul enjoys oatmeal with plant-based milk and nut butter. For lunch, he fuels up with pasta or brown rice with Beyond Meat sausage, grilled vegetables, and a curry sauce. His chef told USA Today, "The main thing is, we try to keep it as light and clean as possible for his normal routine, with organic ingredients. Anything that can minimize body inflammation. Chris is always worrying about what he can and can't eat." So far it appears he's getting it right. In an exclusive interview with The Beet's Awesome Vegans columnist Elysabeth Alfano, Paul said eating a plant-based diet helps him keep up with players half his age. In 2016, Kaepernick made the switch to veganism with his longtime girlfriend to recover from a series of injuries that had him down for the count. The Beet recently reported on how this dietary switch has allowed Kaepernick to stay strong and healthy. Now, he's in the gym building muscle and looks fitter than ever. But will he be picked up? The professional football player claims that a vegan diet makes him feel "always ready" to perform his best on the field. Cam Newton just replaced Tom Brady, who also follows a mostly plant-based diet, as the New England Patriot's QB, after having made the plant-based switch back in March 2019. The NFL Star first decided to ditch meat and dairy to recover quicker from injuries when he learned that a plant-based diet is proven to help reduce inflammation. "I've seen such a remarkable change in the way my body responds to the food that I eat," Newton told PETA for his recent partnership for a new campaign called, "Built Like a Vegan," proving that you don't need to eat meat to be strong. Newton enjoys a meat-free burger on a pretzel bun, heavy on pickles and sauce. He adds: "People often ask, 'How do you get your protein?' I just say, 'I get it in the same way you do, but it's fresher and cleaner.' " Newton shares how to do it: "My advice to a person who wants to become vegan is to eat on schedule. If you can eat on a schedule, you won't miss [a meal or crave meat] or think anything different, and you'll be alright." Elijah Hall says about his vegan diet: "Going vegan was the best decision" he has ever made. Hall holds records in the indoor 200 meters and was training for the Tokyo this summer when it got postponed by a year due to the pandemic. Hall said "the effects that it’s having on my body are amazing. Becoming a plant-based athlete has opened many doors to my health and my training." We predict he'll only get faster in the next 11 months and break records, come home with golf and be the world champion in 12 months. Five-years ago, Morgan Mitchell went vegan and it made her faster, leaner and happier. Last year she was featured in the plant-based athletes documentary The Game Changers and said, “Being vegan has helped me immensely. I don’t feel sluggish like I did when I was eating meat, and my recovery from training really took off. It felt like an overall cleanse for my body, and I started seeing greater results on the track.” Now Michelle is committed for the planet as well. “Ultimately helping the environment and not contributing to animal cruelty was a big thing for me, too. That was my initial reason for going vegan, and the rest of the benefits were just added bonuses.” Mitchell describes what she eats in a day for enhanced performance and more energy to win sprints. “I like to make sure I have three different types of protein in there. I use tofu, beans, and mushrooms, along with spinach, vegan cheese, and hash browns,” she says. “I also love to add Beyond Meat for more flavor, which is a great source of plant protein as well. That usually keeps me full for the better part of the day," she told Well + Good. "We were taught that eating animal products was good for us but we've been lied to for hundreds of years," said Lewis Hamilton. The Beet reported on Hamiltion's vegan diet quoting The New York Times that he credits his new plant-based diet with making the difference in his career. Hamilton gave up processed food and animal products for vegetables, fruit, nuts, grains, because of his strong compassion for animals, for the benefit of the environment, and his own health. Hamilton isn't the only vegan in his family. His dog Rocco is fully vegan and Hamilton says he's "super happy" on Rocco's very own IG post. Earlier this year, Hamilton gave up his private jet because he said it's a big pollutant and aims to live a sustainable lifestyle. Back in February, he started a line of sustainable clothing with Tommy Hilfiger at London Fashion Week. Featured in The Game Changers for his elite strength and his superhuman ability to lift a car, Patrik Baboumiam is one of the strongest men in the world and also happens to be vegan. Baboumian lifted 358 pounds in the 2009 German log lift nationals. Back in 2014, Baboumiam partnered with PETA in his campaign "Want to be Stronger" describing powering yourself with plants and how you can build muscle without eating meat. One of his 2019 PETA campaigns showed him posing with crossed arms and leaves in his mouths with the text: "The world's strongest animals are plant-eaters: Gorillas, buffaloes, elephants and me." Bahoumiam's diet consists of a dairy-free shake for breakfast with 8 grams of protein and 0 carbohydrates. For lunch, he enjoys vegan sausage, falafel, low-fat oven fires, peppers, and more grilled veggies. He normally eats 250 grams of carbs and 90 grams of protein just for lunch. Dinner includes vegetables cooked potatoes, and tofu. If you want to eat like Boubanian, he reports his food diary on his blog BarBend. Here's a guy who has worn many hats: Bodybuilder, Terminator, California Governor, and now vegan and advocate for the plant-based lifestyle. Arnold Schwarzenegger ditched meat and dairy and has proven that you don't need to eat animal products to be strong, healthy and reverse symptoms of heart disease. Now 73, he had a pulmonary valve replacement 1997 due to a congenital defect and underwent emergency open-heart surgery in 2018 to replace the valve again. He then changed his eating and fitness habits and now extolls the virtues of plant-based eating for the environment as well as health reasons. He is a producer of The Game Changers (a movie with many masters) and an advocate for going vegan for health, the environment and the sake of animals (he posts on IG with his pet donkey and miniature pony, both household dwelling animals). Schwarzenegger said last year: "Right now, seven million people are dying every year. That is alarming and everyone in the government has the responsibility to protect the people.... 28 percent of the greenhouse gasses come from eating meat and from raising cattle, so we can do a much better job." Jurek is an extreme ultra-marathon runner who has won the Hardrock Hundred, the Badwater Ultramarathon, the Spartathlon, and the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run (you get the idea). Jurek has been vegan for almost two decades, after easing into it by cutting out meat in college, he slowly stopping seafood and finally giving up all animal products once he realized that eating this way made him feel healthier and happier. To run such an extreme amount of miles, you need to fuel your body with plant-based foods that will give you enough energy and carbohydrates to go the distance. The goal is to eat 5,000-6,000 calories of plant-based foods daily. Jurek outlined his plant-based diet in an interview with Bon Appetite. Instead of waking up to a hot cup of coffee to boost energy, he prefers to drink tea and a green smoothie with spirulina or chlorella and a host of other ingredients. He adds bananas, frozen pineapple slices, or mangoes, brown rice and pea protein, (for protein) to rebuild what's lost in training. This is not just any smoothie. Soccer star, Alex Morgan is one of the beloved members of the USA National Team that won the World Cup and has shown that the female players deserve to get equal pay as their male counterparts by the US Soccer Federation. She is also an animal rights advocate and longtime vegan, having given up meat when she decided that "it didn't feel fair to have a dog, and yet eat meat all the time,” referring to her adorable pup Blue. Morgan aims to eat 90 grams of plant-based protein daily to stay fit and lean, especially for her workouts and on the field. Morgan admitted that breakfast was difficult because "a lot of the things I love like pancakes and French toast had dairy and eggs." But now she enjoys oatmeal with nut butter and berries, smoothies, rice, quinoa, veggies, black beans, protein shakes, Mediterranean food, Impossible burgers, Mexican beans, and sauteed veggie burritos, she told USA Today. Paul Rabil who played for the Boston Cannons and the New York Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, ditched meat and dairy after his 2019 season ended and revealed he's now "officially" vegan on YouTube. "At first [switching to a plant-based diet] was to help solve some pain and trauma that I was going through. Over the last two years, I've had two herniated discs.... and that has led to a ton of shooting pain down my legs, its called sciatica," Rabil explains the purpose of his diet switch. He adds: "I've tried to a lot of things; I've had a number of cortisone shots; I've done physical therapy for two years. And I reached a place where I was thinking 'okay maybe I can solve this with nutrition because a lot of our pain stems from inflammation. Within a few weeks, I started noticing a lot of alleviation so I started focusing and doubling down more on veganism" Hannah Teter won Olympic gold and silver in the halfpipe and is also a seven-time XGames medalist. She changed her diet after watching the documentary, Earthlings when she discovered how "horrible" factory farming is. After a strict vegetarian diet, Teter liked the way she performed and believes that her diet helped her win gold at the 2006 games. She now considers herself "plant-based" and in an interview with the Huffington Post, Teter said, "I feel stronger than I’ve ever been, mentally, physically, and emotionally. My plant-based diet has opened up more doors to being an athlete. It’s a whole other level that I’m elevating to. I stopped eating animals about a year ago, and it’s a new life. I feel like a new person, a new athlete." Djokovic is not the only tour player to go plant-based. Nick Kyrgios shared that he does not eat meat anymore because of his strong compassion for animals. During the time of the Australian wildfires, the Aussie native explained: "I've been passionate about animal welfare for some time now. I don't eat meat or dairy anymore. That’s not for my health, I just don’t believe in eating animals." "I tried a vegan diet a couple of years ago but with all the travel I do, it was hard to stick to it. Since then I've managed to make it work, and I've been vegetarian for quite a while. "Seeing the footage of these animals suffering from the fires only reinforces why I've chosen this diet. When I see these terrible photos, I can’t comprehend eating meat." Matt Frazier has run 27 ultra-marathons in his career so far and continues to write about the endurance strength of being a vegan athlete in his personal blog, which he started 11 years ago: No Meat Athlete. The Beet recently interviewed Frazier about his vegan journey and how to be a successful athlete on a plant-based diet. When asked about the first time he ditched meat Frazier replied, "I had already cut 90 minutes off my first marathon time. I was still 10 minutes away from the Boston Marathon qualifying time. I had plateaued, and I was not sure how I was going to find 10 minutes. [Plant-based eating] was what I was missing. That’s what it took. The other big noticeable difference to me [after going vegan] was I stopped getting injured. Injuries had always been a big part of my running journey. When I became vegan, it was around the time I ran three 50-milers and a 100-miler. I didn’t have any injuries. If it’s done right, [plant-based diets] can really help you recover faster." Rowing is grueling. It's known as the toughest endurance sport in the world. The world record-breaking female rower, Michaela Copenhaver went vegan in 2012 for ethical reasons, she told Great Vegan Athletes. “Initially, I just wanted to eat more vegetables. Those things are super good for you, and they're delicious. Being vegetarian and vegan made me more conscious of how many servings I was getting a day (or not).” When she switched from vegetarian to vegan it was almost accidental: “I was traveling for a regatta in the fall of 2012. I had been vegetarian for 1.5 years already but relied pretty heavily on dairy and eggs. While I was traveling, I was bouncing from couch to couch and had no way to safely store dairy or eggs—so I decided to try a week without them. I felt great, and it wasn’t nearly as scary as I thought. I’ve been vegan ever since.” Now it's a value system: “Once I stopped eating and using animals, I felt I could finally address a question that had been bothering me for a long time—what right do we have to exploit other creatures? Now, I understand that we have no right, and my motivations are primarily ethical.”

2020-09-16	07:48:00Z	Yahoo Finance		North America Potato Protein Markets, 2020-2025: Intolerance Toward Animal Protein, the New Trend Toward Veganism	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/north-america-potato-protein-markets-074800138.html	Dublin, Sept. 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "North America Potato Protein Market - Growth, Trends and Forecasts (2020 - 2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. North America Potato Protein Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.07% during the forecast period 2020-2025The potato protein market is a part of the plant protein sector, with the latter growing all over the world. The reason for the market's growth is intolerance toward animal protein, the new trend toward veganism, and innovations from the manufacturer's end regarding the extraction technique and applications of potato protein.Sports nutrition is expanding globally, and the increased application of potato protein in sports drinks and weight management supplements is driving the market. The awareness among consumers about potato protein is still quite low. This poses a challenge for the market's growth.Key Market TrendsGrowing Application of Potato Protein in Sports NutritionProtein from potato is of relatively high nutritional quality and, therefore, has a high potential for utilization in food products.Potato protein isolates have also been incorporated into sports nutrition and supplements, in order to support muscle synthesis and counter fatigue. For example, in 2013, Genuine Health launched a range of supplements, Activfuel+, Activerecover+, and vegan proteins specifically designed for sports enthusiasts. This in turn, boosting the potato protein market in the region.United States Holds the Prominent share in the MarketThe driving factors for the United States market are the change in consumption patterns and food requirements, and inclination toward vegetarian products for protein sources. The plant protein market is more saturated in the country than other countries, although the new trend of pea and other vegetable proteins is boosting the market growth. Unsuspected by many, this increase is often associated with the effort to eat more protein. But even among the lower-income population, the US protein consumption tends to be excessive. Furthermore, many people do not realize that saturated fat and cholesterol tend to be high in high protein animal foods.Competitive LandscapeThe leading companies are focused on the expansion of their potato protein businesses, in the local and international markets. Avebe and Omega Protein Corporation are among the most active companies, with Avebe having entered two partnerships, one product launch, and one expansion. Omega protein corporation has acquired Bioriginal and Cyvex to enhance its protein ingredient profile.

Do not use without permission) One in 20 people believe 'vegans can eat meat', according to a new poll. 3,739 non-vegans around the world were surveyed by ChewsyGum.com, which wanted to uncover some common misconceptions. While one in 20 believe vegans can eat meat, 16 percent think they eat cheese, and one percent think they cannot eat bananas. George Driscoll, vegan and owner of sustainable travel Instagram account @immyandgeorge, spoke to ChewsyGum about the survey results. He said he would rather a few people get the wrong idea of veganism and do it imperfectly, than one person turns entirely vegan. He added that while some people think 'veganism is lavish and expensive', there are many cheap and easy plant-based meals, like beans on toast or lentil dhal. Driscoll revealed that he used to laugh at vegans himself, but after giving up all animal products himself he has 'never felt happier', and cares a lot about animals and the planet. He concluded that he wishes people would ask more questions about veganism - and follow them up to find out the answers and 'make informed choices'. Maria is the editor of Plant Based News. Her work has been published by The Guardian, The Huffington Post, and various regional newspapers, as well as Vegan Life magazine.

2020-09-15	17:20:36Z	Mic	By Melissa Pandika	Meet Genesis Butler, the 13-year-old activist with a plan to save the earth	https://www.mic.com/p/meet-genesis-butler-the-13-year-old-activist-with-a-plan-to-save-the-earth-34000992	While much of the country took up tie-dye and bread baking when the pandemic hit, 13-year-old Genesis Butler launched a global youth movement to discuss the impacts of animal agriculture on climate change. Now, Youth Climate Save boasts more than 70 chapters in places as far away as India and the U.K. Its members hold weekly Zoom meetings to plan fundraising and other actions youth can take online, as well as an upcoming vegan support group. A sense of urgency animates Butler, who cites research on how a shift to veganism can fight climate change. âThatâs basically what Iâve been focusing on, just talking about how if we donât start going vegan, weâre not going to have a planet,â she says with sobering, wide-eyed earnestness. Butler speaks with Mic over Zoom from her momâs house in Long Beach, California. When she excuses herself mid-conversation to tell her younger siblings to be quiet, earbuds in her ears, she seems like any other teen, but she conveys conviction far beyond her years. Besides Youth Climate Save, the vegan activist founded Genesis for Animals, a nonprofit that helps fund animal sanctuaries, when she was only 11. By speaking out against the mass production of animals, she seeks to create a world where all creatures can thrive. More broadly, her work reflects Gen Zâs collective anxiety over the very real possibility that the most devastating effects of climate change could unfold in their lifetime. Worldwide, 70% of people are reducing their meat consumption or spurning meat altogether, according to a report by learning and data analytics company GlobalData, referenced by Forbes. Many cite health reasons for following a plant-based diet, as well as concerns about the inhumane conditions at factory farms, responsible for 90% of the global meat supply, per the Sentience Institute. Then there are all the environmental impacts of animal agriculture, including greenhouse gas emissions, the clearing of forests for grazing and growing feed crops, and the pollution of communities of color. Factory farms may even birth the next pandemic, Vox reports. Butler became a vegetarian at age three, when she asked her mom where chicken nuggets came from. Initially, her mom responded that they came from the grocery store. Unsatisfied, Butler pressed her mom until she explained that chickens needed to be killed to produce them. âI was devastated,â she recalls. She forayed into veganism three years later, after she saw her mother nursing her younger sister, which made her wonder about the origins of the milk she drank. Her mom explained that it came from mother cows, which Butler then compared to people taking her momâs milk to give to people other than her baby sister. âI never thought of it that way,â her mom told her. Butler went vegan, and her parents and three younger siblings followed suit. The six-year-old had reached a crossroads, though. Gymnastics consumed all her time, especially now that sheâd started training for the Junior Olympics. But activism called her. Eventually, she gave up gymnastics to focus on activism. The response to the TEDx talk she gave at age 10, urging people to consider the environmental impacts of meat consumption, affirmed her choice. She began gaining a following, receiving invitations to speak âall over the place,â she says. âI thought, âThis is what Iâm here for.ââ That realization took time, though, especially for someone who considers herself âvery introverted,â but sheâs learned to adapt. And activism runs in her blood: CÃ©sar ChÃ vez is her great grand-uncle. Learning about how he continued protesting, even when people threatened to call the cops on him, inspired her. âIt just influenced me to be brave and not really care what people think.â After Butler went vegan at age six, she started visiting animal sanctuaries, which offer refuge for animals who canât survive in the wild. Her favorite is New Life Animal Sanctuary in Lake Elsinore, California, where the animals are rescued from labs and slaughterhouses. âThe animals are so trusting and sweet, even after everything theyâve been through.â Two years ago, after talking to owners about the staggering financial costs of running a sanctuary, Butler started Genesis for Animals to raise funds for animal care at sanctuaries, including food, shelter, and veterinarian visits. She donates the money she earns from speaking events, and a link on her nonprofitâs website allows others to make tax-deductible donations. âItâs mainly just me,â she says of Genesis for Animals. âMy parents will help me if I have any questions.â She tells Mic that her ultimate goal for her nonprofit is to keep fundraising so sanctuaries can continue taking in animals, especially as more slaughterhouses shut down due to coronavirus outbreaks. Many argue that closing slaughterhouses leaves droves of animals with nowhere to go, but Butler believes this ignores a larger problem: the mass production of animals. âIf theyâre not mass produced anymore, then we wouldnât have as many as we have right now,â she says. To tackle this deeply entrenched practice, Butler discourages people from buying meat. âPeople are voting with their money, so when youâre buying meat, youâre basically saying itâs ok to kill animals,â she explains. She owes the recent proliferation of vegan meats and other products to consumers increasingly saying âyesâ to them. To justify their meat purchases, some people say â'Itâs humane, itâs grass-fed,'" she explains. But âthereâs no such thing as humane meat. You canât kill animals and say it was ok, because no animal wants to be killed.â Butler has seen a glimpse of what animals experience in their final moments while attending pig vigils outside the Farmer John slaughterhouse in Vernon, California, where activists greet trucks loaded with pigs before their death. âWhen you look at their eyes, theyâre really scared,â she says. Friends sheâs taken to pig vigils have since stopped eating meat. âIf you saw these animals before they died, you wouldnât eat them anymore.â To Butler, animal welfare isn't that complicated. "I think animal welfare is just being fair to animals and treating them how we want ourselves to be treated. And its importance resides in what we share with them: certain physical features, personalities, emotions. They just want to be loved like me and you," she says. "We don't give them credit for what they have to go through." Recently, Butler was immortalized as a vegan superhero on Disney +âs Marvel Hero Project, an animated series featuring young change makers. âThey gave me my own episode,â she says. âThat was also really cool since I am a person of color.â She believes itâs important for other young BIPOC to see her engaged in this work, since it can inspire them to do the same. âI think veganism is thought of as a white thing or thing for hippies to do, but itâs not,â she says, pointing to her own indigenous, Black, and Mexican ancestry. âThere are people of all races and backgrounds who are vegan.â These days, Butler has been busy with online high school classes, cleaning her room, and responding to Instagram comments, story replies, and DMs, often from people seeking advice on shifting to veganism. One of Youth Climate Saveâs projects is to create a support group for youth who want to go vegan and/or get their families to do so, which will include tips, recipes, and other resources, and launch sometime this month, she tells Mic. Indeed, Gen Z appears to be embracing the plant-based lifestyle more than previous generations. âI think this generation is talking about veganism now because itâs the easiest thing we can do about climate change,â Butlerâs explains. âAdults are talking about [veganism] a little bit, but not as much as they should, so youth are stepping up and doing it.â Her words carry the weight of an existential crisis that teenagers like Butler shouldnât have to grapple with, the result of systems established long before they were even born. When asked where she sees herself in five years, she responds that sheâll be in high school; sheâs unsure about attending college, since she already knows she wants to run an animal sanctuary. She also hopes that by then, all animals can live freely, and more of us will start going vegan. After all, she notes, five years is a long time â a comment that might make us old-timers smile, until you remember it accounts for nearly half of Butlerâs life, and that the weâre seeing the devastating impacts of climate change right now. With an unsettling matter-of-factness, she describes the sunâs deep red hue and the ash falling from the sky where she lives, due to the blazes engulfing the West Coast, whose unprecedented scale experts have attributed to climate change. âWeâre running out of time,â she says. âIâm trying to do something about it now before itâs too late.â

2020-09-01	07:00:00Z	Green Matters	sophie	Why Vegans Don't Wear Silk	https://www.greenmatters.com/p/why-dont-vegans-wear-silk	Silk is often touted as an eco-friendly, natural, material — but with so many fabrics out there, it can be hard to determine what is really sustainable, and what simply has gotten a sustainable reputation. Questions about the sustainability of silk may have you wondering why silk is not considered a vegan fabric — because if going vegan is one of the most impactful lifestyle changes we can make for the planet, why don’t vegans wear silk? Read on to learn more about why vegans do not purchase silk, how silk is made, and whether or not silk is as eco-friendly as it may seem. Vegans don’t eat, wear, or use products made from or by animals, instead opting for animal-free and cruelty-free food, clothing, and products. Silk is made from fibers spun by worms, who are animals, in a process that’s surprisingly cruel and typically ends with the worms being killed. For those reasons, vegans typically do not wear or use silk. Silk is a fabric made from the fibers that silkworms spin when they are building their cocoons. Most silk is made from domesticated silkworms that are raised on farms, just like how meat and dairy come from animals bred and raised on farms. There are a few different processes when it comes to taking silk from worms, but here’s one of the most common processes for how worms commercially make silk, as explained by ThoughtCo. After being bred, the silkworms are fed mulberry leaves (hence the name “mulberry” silk). Once they are ready to spin their cocoons, they enter the pupal stage. At that point, they secrete a liquid version of silk from two glands in their heads, and form their cocoons. In nature, the worms would eventually chew through their cocoon, emerge as a moth, and fly away. However, in the silk industry, this is the point where farmers drop the cocoons, which contain the live silkworms, in boiling water. This not only kills the worms, but also unravels the cocoons, resulting in the formation of long silk threads. Unfortunately, this process has a very low fabric yield. According to PETA, around 3,000 silkworms are killed to make just one pound of silk. Or, as ThoughtCo puts it, for just one gram of silk thread, 15 silkworms are killed; and for one silk sari, 10,000 are killed. UK's @StellaMcCartney is an advocate for #WomenEmpowerment. She created gown using 🇮🇳 Oshadi’s peace silk & wove perfect story of #IndiaUK #UnbeatableCombination at @Commonwealth18 #FashionIsGREAT @AntoniaRomeoUK @smritiirani @TexMinIndia @GCC_ECOAGE pic.twitter.com/OHyfoM63i2 Peace Silk, also known as Ahimsa Silk (ahimsa is Sanskrit for non-violence), is a process of harvesting silk from worms without killing them, according to Treehugger. Stella McCartney is famously a vegetarian fashion house, eschewing animal-based leather and fur, but she does use silk — primarily, commercial silk, but occasionally, Peace Silk. As explained on the luxury designer’s website, Peace Silk is made the same way as commercial silk; the key difference is that the farmers allow the silkworms to naturally emerge from their cocoons as moths, and then fly away. At that point, the farmers gather the silk from the abandoned cocoons. However, revamping the silk industry is not as simple as everyone switching to Peace Silk. For one thing, this method produces broken silk thread, as opposed to the long silk threads that are created by the worms in the commercial silk industry. The threads then need to be woven together, Stella McCartney explains. Because of that, Peace Silk is more expensive than commercial silk. Not only that, but the process is still not one most vegans would condone, as it still involves the breeding and use of silkworms. Additionally, the worms used in the silk industry have been bred over centuries to be optimal for producing silk (much like chickens, cows, pigs, and other animals in the factory farming system), so even though they are “set free” once they become moths, they can only survive for five to 10 days after leaving their cocoons, according to mueZart. Some vegans are comfortable purchasing and wearing clothing made from secondhand silk, as doing so takes the item out of the waste stream, and does not contribute to the demand for more silk. But fortunately, if you do not want to wear silk, there are many alternatives. Silky fabric alternatives are often made from semi-natural, semi-synthetic fabrics such as viscose, rayon, lyocell (aka TENCEL), and modal. These fabrics are all semi-synthetic cellulosic materials, according to the blog Ecocult, and in many cases, are biodegradable, and sometimes even compostable. Other silk fabric alternatives can be made with synthetic fibers, most commonly polyester. Of course, polyester is generally not seen as eco-friendly, as it is made from petroleum. But because synthetic fabrics do not involve any animal exploitation, vegans are likely to choose polyester over silk — but a great middle ground choice is a garment made from viscose, rayon, lyocell, or modal. Silk is most commonly used to make clothing including neckties, blouses, wedding dresses and evening gowns, and lingerie; it’s also sometimes used to make household items like silk pillowcases and dental floss. Fortunately, there are vegan versions of all these items — and not only will they be free of animal cruelty, but synthetic and semi-synthetic fabrics are typically cheaper than natural silk. Click here for a list of brands using vegan silk. According to the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s Higg Index, and as reported by Ecocult, “silk has by far the worst impact on the environment of any textile, including polyester, viscose/rayon, and lyocell. It’s worse than the much-demonized cotton, using more fresh water, causing more water pollution, and emitting more greenhouse gases.” Even though silk is biodegradable, the process of harvesting silk has a very high environmental impact — mostly in terms of energy use, but also in terms of chemical use (some silk farms use formaldehyde, chlorine, and other toxic chemicals), fresh water use, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, silk contributes to those latter three factors even more than cotton does. Surprisingly, the Higg Index found polyester to be the lowest-impact alternative to silk — even lower impact than the semi-natural fabrics listed above. 100 percent silk fabric will break down in your compost pile — but it will take longer than the average banana peel to break down. According to various sources, it could take up to a year to completely return to the earth. That said, before chucking an old silk blouse in the compost bin, investigate the material of your silk garment’s surrounding fabric, as it could be layered with a synthetic lining, or sewn together with synthetic thread. According to the blog Can I Compost This?, makers of garments with natural fibers sometimes get away with using polyester-based thread, which will not break down in the compost. So if you don’t mind plucking the thread out of your compost heap after the garment has disappeared, go for it. Just don’t put it in a compost bin that you do not monitor (such as your municipality’s curbside compost service), since the thread could contaminate the batch. Additionally, silk dental floss is compostable, and it generally breaks down in backyard compost bins in 6 to 10 months, according to the brand Dental Lace. And good news for those who avoid the use of silk — the brand also makes a plant-based floss that is compostable.
2020-09-15	13:08:32Z	Healthline	Alina Petre, MS, RD (NL)	Incomplete Protein: Is It a Concern?	https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/incomplete-protein	Plant-based sources of protein are often deemed inferior to animal-based ones, as the former is said to contain “incomplete” proteins. This causes many to fear they may be getting the wrong type or quantity of protein when following a vegetarian or vegan diet. However, there are many reasons why this belief should be considered more of a myth than a reality. This article discusses the difference between “complete” and “incomplete” proteins, as well as why vegetarians and vegans have little reason to fear getting too little of the former and too much of the latter. Protein is made up of building blocks called amino acids. Although hundreds of amino acids exist in nature, only 20 are needed to make all of the protein found in your body. These can be split into three main categories (1): Foods that contain good amounts of all nine essential amino acids are generally considered sources of “complete” protein, whereas those that don’t are labeled as “incomplete” protein. Protein is made from amino acids, which can be categorized as essential, non-essential, or conditionally essential. Protein-rich foods are typically categorized as “complete” or “incomplete” based on the amount of essential amino acids they contain. Contrary to popular belief, most foods — both animal- and plant-based ones — contain all nine essential amino acids. The difference lies in the amounts of them they offer. For instance, meat, fish, eggs, and dairy contain high levels of all nine essential amino acids. On the other hand, plants tend to contain low amounts of at least one or two essential amino acids, depending on the category to which they belong. For example, legumes and veggies tend to be low in methionine and cysteine, while grains, nuts, and seeds tend to be low in lysine (2). In practical terms, this means that following a diet providing too little of either food group may cause you to get insufficient amounts of essential amino acids. This is why animal-based foods are typically considered “complete” sources of protein, while most plant-based foods are considered “incomplete.” The exceptions are soy, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and nutritional yeast, as well as hemp and chia seeds. These plant foods offer good amounts of all nine essential amino acids and are considered “complete” sources of plant protein. With a few exceptions, most plant-based foods are typically viewed as “incomplete” sources of protein. In contrast, animal-based foods are considered “complete” proteins. Many people believe that due to vegetarian and vegan diets’ low content of animal-based protein, they often lack sufficient amounts of “complete” protein. However, apart from a few exceptions, this is very seldom the reality. Currently, there’s no evidence of protein deficiency among vegetarians or vegans, except perhaps in the small percentage who eat too few calories or follow monotonous or restricted eating patterns, such as fruitarian or potato-based diets (3). Nonetheless, the protein found in plants can be slightly more difficult for your body to absorb, compared with the protein in meat and other animal-based foods. This is why vegetarians and vegans are sometimes encouraged to eat slightly more protein than meat eaters — that is, around 0.5 grams per pound (1 gram per kg) per day (4). That said, the current evidence suggests that this difference in absorption is likely too minimal to cause vegetarians or vegans to get insufficient amounts of essential amino acids from their diet (3). In short, as long as a plant-based diet remains rich enough in calories and offers a good variety of protein sources, there’s little reason to worry about getting too little “complete” protein on a vegetarian or vegan diet. Vegetarians and vegans should have little difficulty getting enough “complete” protein from their diet — that is, as long as it remains varied and rich enough in calories. Protein-rich foods that contain good amounts of all nine essential amino acids are typically considered “complete” sources of protein, while those that don’t are labeled as “incomplete” sources. This causes most plant foods to be viewed as “incomplete” proteins, perpetuating the myth that plant-based diets may not offer the right amount or type of protein. That said, as long as a plant-based diet contains a good variety of food groups and enough calories, there’s little reason for vegetarians or vegans to worry about “complete” or “incomplete” proteins. Note that this applies to healthy individuals of average weight. However, nutrient needs may vary depending on your activity level, body weight, and health status. If you’re losing weight or lack energy, consult a medical professional or registered dietitian.

Had it been just a food trend, it would have come and gone. People who follow a plant-based diet swear that it is indeed a way of living that excludes all forms of animal products. We spoke to Palak Mehta, CEO of VeganFirst, a vegan publication and solution space that seeks to enable the plant-based eco-system in India to help understand the movement. WHAT IS A VEGAN DIET? When asked to define veganism, Palak said, “There is a popular misconception, that veganism is a diet. Although most people start by following a vegan diet, it extends to one's lifestyle choices as well. Veganism is a belief system that is against the commodification of animals. In layman words, no animal ingredients, derivatives should be present in your products, services, or in the way you obtain them.” WHY IS EVERYONE TURNING VEGAN? It isn’t exactly breaking news that we’ve been living unsustainably for centuries. According to Cowspiracy, animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation and a plant-based diet cuts your carbon emissions by 50 percent. Talking about animal products, Palak explained, “A vegetarian diet is based on a false premise. A vegetarian consumes animal derivatives such as milk, honey, and several other animal products like gelatin and rennet which we many are not aware of.” With growing climate change concerns and celebrities endorsing its health benefits, veganism is at an all-time high. The commoners are beginning to see the benefits of veganism. People have different motivations to go vegan- ethical, environmental, and health; it can also be a combination of all three. Ever since the White Revolution, India’s dairy consumption and production have been among the largest in the world. A sumptuous Indian diet tends to include milk, ‘ghee’, ‘dahi’, and ‘paneer’. Many of our beloved ‘mithais’ have milk-based products in them, so how are Indians adapting to veganism? “Veganism is catching up as India’s food habits get exposed to global culture. Stories of people who have successfully reversed their diabetes, hypertension, and PCOS have inspired many. If we look at our Indian dishes, we are surrounded by rich vegan food like ‘rajma chawal’, ‘dal’, ‘roti’, ‘sabzi’, ‘aloo tikki’, and much more- most Indian food can easily be veganised. You will be surprised to know that even Mahatma Gandhi spoke against the consumption of milk because of the cruelty involved in it”, said Palak. Awareness about benefits of Veganism backed by scientific research will help people adapt. Online platforms like VeganFirst also play a key role where people can find out information about Indian vegan recipes, restaurants, events, nutritionists, and engage with a like-minded community who can provide the motivation and support needed. 1.

2020-09-14	22:10:25Z	Eater Chicago	Ashok Selvam	Vegan Queen Karyn Calabrese Returns With Virtual Restaurant	https://chicago.eater.com/2020/9/14/21436239/karyns-calabrese-vegan-jam-virtual-restaurant-open-delivery	Longtime vegan advocate Karyn Calabrese is returning to the restaurant world after a three-year absence. Calabrese is partnering with popular Logan Square restaurant Jam to run a vegan takeout and delivery operation. For now it’s a pop-up, but Calabrese and Jam owner Anthony Fiore hope this revival of Karyn’s Cooked, her River North restaurant that closed in 2016, becomes a permanent neighborhood fixture. Calabrese feels her best when she’s feeding other people, she says, and has been plotting her comeback since 2017. That’s when she closed her flagship Lincoln Park restaurant inside a space she occupied for 18 years. Losing her business forced her to change her lifestyle, including a move from her luxury Gold Coast condo to suburban Flossmoor. Lawsuits and allegations from former workers left her humbled: “If you would have said a few years ago that I was moving to Flossmoor, I would have said they were out of their f-ing mind,” she says. At the same time, the 73-year-old former model says she’s overcome even more. Her Lincoln Park restaurant burned down in 2012. She survived a chaotic childhood in which she never met her father. Karyn’s Raw opened in 2000 in Lincoln Park, and Calabrese quickly became a star as she touted her diet and upscale lifestyle. She appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show that same year, which expanded her reach. More recently, Empire actress Taraji P. Henson points to a photo of the septuagenarian in a bikini as motivation in how to age gracefully. Calabrese would open two other restaurants: Karyn’s on Green debuted in 2010 in West Loop and closed in 2015. Karyn’s Cooked opened in 2003 and closed in 2016. According to Calabrese, the West Loop restaurant doomed her business by being too big for the demand: “If it were open now, I’d be killing it,” she says. Jam owner Anthony Fiore says he’s long been a fan of Karyn’s cooking. They’ve known each other for about 15 years, and Fiore has been searching for a way to continue operations. Jam, known for an eclectic breakfast menu — including a knockout French toast — has remained closed during the pandemic. Fiore says Jam isn’t well suited for social distancing. While Fiore isn’t vegan (his fiance is, he says), he’s hopeful more folks will try Karyn’s foods, like vegan lasagna. Other items on the menu include chili, black bean burgers, and grilled jackfruit with barbecue sauce. The ghost kitchen will give more people access to quality vegan food and grab-and-go items. Fiore hopes the new venture will be a boon for Logan Square: “People are looking for this type of food,” Fiore says. The “Karyn’s” name evokes passionate reactions among Chicago’s vegan community. Calabrese’s restaurants were pioneering, giving the city meat- and dairy-free options in Downtown Chicago, where pricey steakhouses still hold a large marketshare. Meat-free options were viewed through a different lens in the early ‘00s, as Chicago sometimes could be pigeonholed as only a meat and potatoes town. Vegetarian restaurants — like Chicago Diner in Boystown — did exist but were rare. International restaurants that didn’t serve meat, like the Indian restaurants along Devon Avenue, hadn’t discovered how to properly market themselves to mainstream vegans, including those with trepidations about “ethnic food.” But Calabrese figured out the formula and became Chicago’s vegan queen. Depite the spotlight that Calabrese brought to veganism in Chicago, there were still people who question her intentions and ones who dislike her unflappable confidence. An ex-employee posted several allegations about her business in 2016. The former worker’s personal blog questioned Calabrese’s commitment to veganism and her ethics, pointing to the fact that she fed meat to her dog, something Calabrese openly admits. “God intended dogs to eat meat,” she says. Chicago’s vegans continue to discuss Calabrese: a post made Monday on a vegan Facebook group included banter about the leather seats in her old Bentley. Did that make her vegan enough? Calabrese’s loyalists defended her, dismissing any criticism as heresy. Beyond the ghost kitchen with Jam, Calabrese has more plans. For now, check out the return of Karyn’s Cooked, which is back starting Monday, September 14. Karyn’s Cooked, inside Jam, 2853 N. Kedzie Avenue, order via UberEats or DoorDash.

2020-08-26	16:44:12Z	The Beet	miriamporter	The 10 Best Vegan Cheeses That Taste Like the Real Thing	https://thebeet.com/the-10-best-vegan-cheeses-that-taste-like-the-real-thing/	Vegan cheese has come a long way since the first time I tried soy cream cheese in the late nineties living in Los Angeles. I remember gagging at the taste and thinking there was no way that spread was going on my precious toasted bagel. Flash forward several decades and plant-based cheeses are better than ever: These days many innovative ingredients like cashews, almond milk, coconut cream, smoky flavor and fermented foods are being utilized by top chefs in the plant-based industry to create plant-based cheeses that far surpasses anything the dairy industry makes. Dairy products are unhealthier, less environmentally friendly, and crueler to animals than plant-based alternatives. By purchasing dairy-free cheeses not only are you saving the lives of cows, but you are supporting companies that value sustainability and the environment. Below are ten delicious vegan cheeses to get you started on your love of plant-based cheese. Chao by Field Roast, famous for its plant-based sausages, is one of the few cheese slices I can eat straight from the package. Of course, it's also great melted in a grilled cheese sandwich with a slice of tomato, in your favorite plant-based lasagna recipe, or shredded on top of a veggie pizza. This creamy cheese is coconut-based and seasoned with fermented tofu for a sweet and savory end product. Good luck eating only one slice! Chao's other flavors, Tomato Cayenne and Creamy Original are equally as delicious. True story - I have never met a Miyoko's Creamery cheese I didn’t absolutely love. I also admire the creative founder, cookbook author, and Chef Miyoko Schinner, and her love for rescued animals and devotion to veganism. The sundried tomato garlic cheese wheel is created with cashew cream and fermented with live cultures. Serve it on grain crackers or get creative and whip up Miyoko’s vegan sundried tomato risotto from their website. I need the Canada/US borders to open already so I can get some Kite Hill cream cheese since it’s not available in Toronto. Three people, one of whom is a talented Chef and creator of the delicious plant-based restaurant Crossroads in Los Angeles, founded Kite Hill. Their velvety smooth almond milk cream cheese is perfect on a toasted bagel with a coffee in the morning. When you need a break from spices and herbs this is one of the best plain varieties on the market. Nuts For Cheese is a Canadian vegan company using ethically sourced and high-quality ingredients like cashews, coconut milk, and nutritional yeast. What began as one Chef in the back of a vegan kitchen has become a full-scale facility whose aim is to spread positive change through food. They have six unique cheese varieties and each one is packed with mouth-watering flavor. The Un-Brie-Lievable is a semi-firm wedge that is rich and creamy and the perfect pairing for my homemade charcuterie board. If you live in the US you can order Nuts For Cheese through Vegan Essentials. Who doesn’t have childhood memories of snacking on cheese sticks before dinner? You can now relive those moments with plant-based Cheeze Sticks by Daiya, perfect when on the go. Ingredients include coconut cream and tapioca starch but unlike their shreds and slices you don’t have to melt the sticks – they are delicious right out of the package (Yes, really). They are also kid-friendly and my vegan son loves them. Your plant-based Greek salads just got a whole lot better. Violife is based in Greece so creating the Just like Feta Block was a natural fit and inspired by their Greek heritage. The tangy block goes perfectly with olives, cherry tomatoes, or a Portobello mushroom. In addition to olive extract and coconut oil, their feta contains Vitamin B12. All their delicious cheese products are vegan because they believe in living in harmony with animals and the environment. Shake it, baby, shake it! Whip up your favorite pasta dish and sprinkle it with tasty Parmesan Grated Topping by Go Veggie for an added kick. It’s totally plant-based but tastes like classic Parmesan cheese. Their website has several yummy looking recipes with ways you can use this Parmesan topping. I did a happy dance the day I discovered Smoked Gouda Slices by Follow Your Heart. Canadians know the brand as Earth Island, but the products are the same. This hickory smoked Gouda is created with natural smoke flavor from plant sources and is the perfect ingredient for a hearty Panini sandwich with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and zucchini. Follow Your Heart began as a soup and sandwich counter and is now a leader in the industry with a full range of plant-based products. No need to travel to France when you can get gourmet soft French-style cheese in over 3,000 stores across the United States. Chipotle-Serrano Pepper by Treeline is created with chipotle Marita flakes, smoky Serrano pepper, and fine cultured cashews. This vegan brand loves all animals, does not use palm oil in any of their products, and provides links to the truth about the dairy industry on its website. You know vegan cheese has gone mainstream when grocery store giants like Whole Foods have their own line. Yup, times have definitely changed. These non-dairy Mozzarella Cheese Shreds melt and stretch for the perfect homemade veggie pizza and are also available in Cheddar. What’s your favorite plant-based cheese? Let us know in the comments.
2020-09-10	16:48:00Z	Chestnut Hill Local	April Lisante	Mother and daughter vegan restaurant team mark anniversary in Chestnut Hill	https://www.chestnuthilllocal.com/stories/mother-and-daughter-vegan-restaurant-team-mark-anniversary-in-chestnut-hill,14909	Tucked in the rear of the building at 8419 Germantown Avenue, just across the street from Weavers Way Co-op, sits a Hill restaurant that aims to change the way we all think about vegan food. Celebrating its first anniversary this month, All the Way Live is the unique creation of a mother-daughter team passionate about the benefits of eating healthy. Owners Beverly Medley and Nyeisha Cabiness hope to convince one diner at a time that eating vegan and raw food can be a truly eye-opening, life-changing experience. For nearly four decades, Medley, 67, has embraced veganism as a part of her life. After reading about the benefits of going vegan in her 20s, she never looked back, devoting her life to cooking from-scratch meals that reflect a no-animal-products mantra. She raised both her children to eat this way and spent 13 years teaching vegan night school classes through Temple University to enlighten Philadelphians. At this stage in her life, her goal is to bring her knowledge, literally, to the table. “I do this from my heart,” Medley said. “I really want people to be healthy, and this is my contribution. This is not only for vegans; this is for all people. Some people advocate veganism and they think everyone has to be that way. I don’t think that. But does that mean a meat eater can’t eat healthy?” After finding success in Germantown at 6108 Germantown Ave. with her flagship All the Way Live, which she and her daughter opened in 2010, she decided to take her dishes to the Hill last September. The opening was a success, and the restaurant was getting busier by the day until the pandemic hit. The quaint 15-seat Hill café serves lunch and dinner and both raw and vegan entrees and desserts. I decided to check in on Medley for the first anniversary, since she was only able to reopen a few weeks ago, following the March shutdown. “It was really picking up, then the pandemic hit me hard,” Medley said. “I had to close.” Medley’s story is an amazing one. Growing up in Virginia, she was raised on heavy Southern food by a mother who homecooked just about everything, from the pies to the breads. “She cooked the Southern way. Everything was from scratch. But not a lot of salads,” Medley said. When she was in her twenties, a friend lent her a paperback copy of Dick Gregory’s “Natural Diet for Folks Who Eat: Cookin’ With Mother Nature” and Medley was intrigued. She did a body cleanse, began to eat vegan, and felt like a million bucks. She wanted to try to help her body avoid diabetes, heart disease and cancer. “I said to my husband I’m changing my diet and he said ‘What?’,” Medley recalled. Sure, she lapsed here and there along the way, she admits, thanks to an acute love of sugar she had to permanently eradicate, but by the time she was pregnant with her first child, Nyeisha, she was committed to the lifestyle. By the time she was pregnant with her son a few years later, she was fully vegan. “My life changed, and I never went back. I never again touched sugar. I never again touched fast food. And I never again ate meat,” Medley said. “And I raised those children [as vegans] when the odds were against me with the schools. But I didn’t flinch.” Medley’s specialty became cooking vegan and raw food from scratch, in the same spirit as her mother’s home cooking ways – but she learned to prepare totally different food. She would cook vegan for herself and then a separate meal for her husband, who was raised in the South and still loved his meat and potatoes. It was while she was taking a night class through Temple University’s Pan African Studies Community Education Program that she realized she wanted to teach others about the way she ate. Given a shot at instructing a night class, the gig became regular for 13 years for Medley. She called it “Food is Your Best Medicine.” And while she was teaching, her daughter Nyeisha was selling vegan dinner platters in the lobby of the building. “She was married and she would come with the children and sell vegan dinners,’ Medley said. Word got out about the tasty food and the mother daughter duo then began feeding locals at a building near her home, a sort of grassroots chef’s tables, if you will. That finally spurred the thought of a permanent restaurant. “A friend of mine said I should open a restaurant because my food is good and its homemade,” said Medley. The 6108 Germantown Ave. location in Germantown was and continues to be a real success, seating about 60 and serving up everything from vegan entrees to raw desserts. Medley opened the Hill location Sept. 21, 2019 at the site of the former Louie’s Little Hut sandwich shop. On the Hill, she features specialties like chickpea burgers, nut meat burgers, apple pie and coconut cream pie. The desserts are considered raw because she uses a dehydrator, which doesn’t raise the temperature above 160 degrees. She also cooks entrees like her housemade lasagna and a yummy zucchini pasta. She is now looking forward to the fall, when she will add some new specials and may even have live music outside occasionally. “I’m looking forward to the fall season,” said Medley. “I want everyone to eat healthy. This is my calling.” For more, see allthewaylivecafe.com This is terrific. Thank you for sharing your experiences and learnings with the community. I love that you made it a fun, family venture. Very inspiring. The restaurants sound fantastic and I look forward to trying it. 
2020-09-15	04:03:40Z	Soapbox Cincinnati	Lauren Caggiano |Tuesday, September 15, 2020	This Black-owned business is bringing vegan treats to the masses, one cookie at a time	https://www.soapboxmedia.com/devnews/Like-Moms-Only-Vegan.aspx	When it comes to a niche, a Cincinnati-based purveyor of vegan treats is challenging norms three times over. Like Mom’s Only Vegan (LMOV) is a woman-owned, Black-owned, and family-owned enterprise that’s taking the Queen City’s food scene by storm. Naimah Sams, LMOV’s communications and branding manager, is the daughter and granddaughter of the co-founders, Naomi Sams and Sakile Chenzira, respectively. The mother and daughter team started the business, and eventually Naimah’s immediate family found themselves in the mix, too. According to Naimah, her mother’s natural knack for the culinary arts was evident to her from a young age. “My upbringing was always a very exciting food journey,” she says. “My mom would make conventional staples of the American diet, like mac and cheese — only vegan. And for birthdays we always had cake and ice cream. So, I never felt left out of anything.” Eventually the word got out about her baking prowess and Naomi decided to take her hobby to the next level. She made a name for herself with her cookies — in particular the chocolate chip version — by setting up shop at Northside Farmers Market. The cookies proved to be a good foray into commercial baking, says Naimah, as they were portable and scalable. And perhaps most importantly, they exposed people to the accessibility and versatility of vegan food. “People were like, ‘Man, this is amazing,’ she says. “And thankfully, the people were already pretty open to the idea of veganism even if they weren't vegan.” Naimah says eventually they expanded with a booth at Findlay Market and they’ve further cemented their brand identity, while building a loyal following and adding cupcakes to their lineup. Speaking of identity, Naimah says being Black-owned and vegan makes them a bit of an anomaly. “I think that there is a misconception in a way about Black people and veganism,” she explains. “We don't get as much exposure as maybe our white counterparts do. But we're out here and we are having fun with our food and we are making a lot of waves through our creations.” So, what’s next for this cruelty-free brand? According to Naimah, the booths at the farmers markets have been a great way to learn how to run a storefront, on a micro level. “It’s been a great learning experience working out of an incubator kitchen and then also working out of Findlay Market to give us an understanding of how it would look if we got our own spot, which of course is our ultimate goal,” she says. “But looking to the future, we'd really love to have a complete LMOV-branded bakery. What we want to do is create a gathering place for people to come in and eat all the vegan sweets they want.” Regarding community building, Naimah says they would also like to forge more partnerships with local restaurants and stores to further expand their reach.
2020-09-14	14:00:00Z	The Canberra Times	Karen Hardy	Do vegans dream of greasy junk food? If you do, check out this cookbook	https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6920100/do-vegans-dream-of-greasy-junk-food-if-you-do-check-out-this-cookbook/	This is the anti-vegan cookbook for vegans. Almost every vegetarian and vegan cookbook focuses on the whole wheat/kefir/green cleanse/salt lamp/lentil aspect of living a cruelty-free diet. But what about those of us who actually dream of a greasy burger all day and all night, but simply can't justify eating animal products? Or those of us who just wanted to opt out of the environmentally unsustainable meat industry? Or anyone who is just keen to broaden their culinary horizons and dip a toe in the waters of veganism? Like author Zacchary Bird. If you see and taste the world the same way as Zac, then this is the cookbook for you. Beer-battered chocolate bars. Picture: Pete Dillon There's something about a beer-battered, deep-fried block of chocolate for dessert that can't be topped. But go for it and top it with ice cream as well. This is one of the few recipes that I occasionally look at and think, well, that's a bit much. Eat while sitting down with your next of kin notified as the calorie coma can set in almost immediately. canola oil, for deep-frying vegan chocolate cookies, broken into chunks 1. Place the chocolate bars in the freezer for 2-3 hours to firm up. 2. Heat the canola oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat. Test if the oil is ready by inserting a wooden skewer or the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil; if it begins to bubble quickly then you're ready to go. 3. Place the flour in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Toss the frozen chocolate bars in the flour to lightly coat, then remove and set aside on a plate. 4. Pour the beer into the flour, stirring constantly, to create a batter. You may not need it all, so go slowly until the batter is runny but not so runny that it won't cling to the chocolate. Dip each chocolate bar into the batter until completely coated. One at a time, scoop the bars out with as much batter as you can keep clinging to them, then bravely drop the battered bars into the oil. Cook for two to three minutes, until golden brown and crisp. 5. Remove the chocolate bars using a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel. Serve warm with a sprinkling of fat sea salt flakes, chocolate sauce, chocolate cookies, soy or rice whip and a few pretzels, or whatever sweet garnishes you have lying around. Note: For a gluten-free version of this dessert, use soda water (club soda) instead of beer and replace the flour with gluten-free flour. Makes about 1 litre. Butternut pumpkin mac 'n' cheese. Picture: Pete Dillon Hidden veggies are a dead trend, joining other failed food fads, such as salads suspended in jell-o, in the hall of shame. It's time to proudly display your love of vegetables, with lumps of pumpkin stirred through this mac 'n' cheese instead of being snuck into the cheese sauce. 200-300g butternut pumpkin, peeled, deseeded and roughly chopped 1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Line a baking tray with baking paper. 2. Place the pumpkin on the prepared tray and bake for 20 minutes or until soft and cooked through. Transfer the pumpkin to a bowl and lazily mash it with a fork to create a lumpy mash. 3. Reduce the oven temperature to 160C. 4. Cook the macaroni according to the packet instructions until just before al dente. Drain and set aside in a medium baking dish. 5. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Sift in the flour and stir constantly for two minutes until you have a roux. Once the roux starts to bubble, gradually whisk in the soy milk a little at a time. When all the milk has been incorporated, stir in three-quarters of the cheese, the garlic powder, mustard and nutritional yeast and cook, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir through the nutmeg, thyme, chilli and sage. 6. Pour the cheese sauce over the cooked pasta, add the mashed pumpkin and gently mix to combine. Season with salt and pepper, then scatter the remaining cheese and the breadcrumbs over the top. 7. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the breadcrumbs are crisp and golden. Allow the mac 'n' cheese to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Serves 3-4. Korean spicy fried "chicken". Picture: Pete Dillon This recipe might be a little time intensive to make from scratch, but one could argue that it takes a lot less time than raising a chicken. Opting for store-bought seitan or faux chicken and rice malt syrup brings the preparation for this recipe down to less than 30 minutes. 700g steamed seitan chickpea chicken, cut into 5cm x 2.5cm irregular chunks canola oil, for deep-frying thinly sliced spring onion, to serve toasted sesame seeds, for sprinkling 6 garlic cloves, minced 95g gochujang, plus extra to taste 1. Combine the seitan chunks, ginger and soy sauce in a large bowl until the ginger is distributed evenly and the seitan has absorbed the soy sauce. 2. In a separate bowl, combine the coating ingredients. Add the seitan, toss to coat and set aside for 10 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, heat the canola oil in a large saucepan or deep-fryer to 180C using a kitchen thermometer to assist you. 4. Toss the seitan pieces again in any remaining coating mixture to achieve a dry exterior. Place immediately into the hot oil and fry for three to four minutes to cook through. If the seitan pieces are browning too quickly, remove from the pan and allow to cool before flash-frying again until crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain and sprinkle with salt. 5. While the seitan is frying, make the sauce. Fry the garlic in a small saucepan with one teaspoon of the hot frying oil over medium heat for two minutes. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce starts to follow the spoon about, adding a splash of water if you want to make it runnier. This should be ready by the time you take the seitan out of the oil. Taste and add an extra squeeze of gochujang if your friends can handle it. 6. Put the finishing touches on your masterpiece by using a pastry brush to paint the sauce onto the surface of the fried seitan, brushing as much flavour as you can into the crevices. Or, less artfully, dump the seitan into a bowl and pour the sauce over the top, tossing until fully coated. 7. Serve with thinly sliced spring onion and toasted sesame seeds scattered over the top. Serves 4. Sausage rolls. Picture: Pete Dillon My sausage rolls are a consistent crowd pleaser, with mushrooms and herbs serving to bulk out your choice of "meat" and give off gourmet vibes. The wash of milk and oil somehow makes them simultaneously crispy and soft, and ensures they're just as good days later if your rolls survive long enough to become cold and old. 1 onion, roughly chopped 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 200g chestnut or button mushrooms, roughly chopped 250g vegan mince or vegan burger patties, broken up into chunks 2 sheets dairy-free frozen puff pastry, just thawed tomato ketchup, to serve 1. Preheat the oven to 200C. 2. Heat one tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes. Add the garlic and mushroom and continue to cook until the mushroom has broken down and any liquid has evaporated. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a food processor, along with the stock cubes, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, thyme or rosemary leaves and the liquid smoke (if using) and blitz to combine. 3. Place the mince in a large bowl and use a fork to mash the mustard, pepper and parsley into the mince. Stir in the mushroom mixture until well combined. Divide the mixture into quarters. 4. Cut the pastry sheets in half and place them in front of you. Evenly spoon the mince mixture along the long edge of each pastry sheet, then fold the pastry sheets over to enclose the filling and use a fork to crimp and seal the edges. Press the sausage rolls down on this crease to seal shut, then cut in half and stuff any filling that's fallen out back into the open ends. 5. Whisk four teaspoons olive oil and the soy milk in a small bowl. Using a pastry brush, brush the mixture over the top of each sausage roll and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds (if using). Bake for 25-35 minutes, until golden. 6. Serve with tomato ketchup or your favourite tomato sauce. 7. The sausage rolls will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for three to four days or in the freezer for up to three months.

2020-07-16	12:00:00Z	The Washington Post	By Carrie Dennett	Veganism and eating disorders: Is there a link?	https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/veganism-and-eating-disorders-is-there-a-link/2020/07/15/0f5fbd44-c6cd-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html	Vegan diets — which exclude all foods of animal origin — were already increasing in popularity, whether for health, ethical or environmental reasons before 2020. But as the novel coronavirus started sweeping across the country, interest in ditching animal foods rose even further, perhaps out of a desire to be as healthy as possible or from discomfort about the news coming out of meatpacking plants. Yet while veganism is becoming more common, it is still relatively rare and therefore somewhat misunderstood. One misconception is that the people who follow this admittedly restrictive diet have an eating disorder. “I come across the stereotype about vegans having eating disorders more so among my fellow health-care professionals than I do the public,” said Chicago-based vegan registered dietitian Taylor Wolfram. That stereotype has long been a barrier to securing treatment for vegans who do have such disorders. Until recently, most eating disorder treatment centers wouldn’t accept vegan clients — especially those who need more intensive inpatient treatment — unless they were willing to start eating animal products. This is a big problem, because when someone who follows a vegan diet is rejected for treatment, it’s an average of two years before they try to seek help again, said Tammy Beasley, vice president of clinical nutrition services for Alsana Eating Disorder Treatment & Eating Recovery Centers. Fortunately, more treatment centers have started to accept vegan patients and allow them to remain vegan, including Alsana, which made the change last fall after more than a year of planning. “We decided that we were going to do this and do it right,” Beasley said. “It’s so critical to remove as many barriers as possible when they get the confidence to seek treatment.” Thinking about your weight? What you might be getting wrong about the Health at Every Size approach. Beasley said that before she dug into the research, she had the same biases against vegan diets as many in the eating disorder field. “I think as a profession we decided that A plus B must equal C,” she said, pointing to a 2003 research paper that concluded that college-age women who become vegetarian may be more likely to develop an eating disorder. That research has received criticism for its design — eating one meatless meal a week was enough to earn participants a “semi-vegetarian” label, and the study population of young, white females was already at higher risk statistically of developing an eating disorder. The researchers also used dietary assessment tools that weren’t designed for use with vegetarians. “I think that often people think that vegan diets and vegans are more ‘extreme’ than they really are,” said Seattle-based registered dietitian Ginger Hultin, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and owner of Champagne Nutrition. “The majority of vegans and vegetarians likely have healthful, balanced diets that meet their needs.” When Beasley recently informally surveyed fellow dietitians who specialize in eating disorders, 98 percent were seeing eating disorder clients who were also vegan. But more than 90 percent of those clients started following a vegan diet after they developed an eating disorder. “We know that often the eating disorder and veganism overlap, but they also may not,” she said. Wolfram said one red flag she watches for is when a vegan isn’t willing to eat what she calls “vegan fun foods” such as vegan meats, cheeses and ice creams. “There can be fearmongering around these foods, just like non-vegan fun foods, and it’s important to open up access and permission to all vegan foods,” she said. “Additionally, if someone is trying to be a ‘perfect vegan,’ that’s never going to happen in our world. People who go down this path often experience anxiety and guilt. I like to help folks figure out where they want to realistically draw the line and how they can best help animals while prioritizing their mental health as well, which looks different for everyone.” Two recent studies on vegan diets and orthorexia — an unhealthy obsession with eating healthy — contradicted each other. One found that vegan diets were associated with orthorexia, but the other did not; the authors in the second study concluded this was probably because most people pursuing veganism do so for ethical, rather than dietary, reasons. That said, Wolfram said that even if someone became an ethical vegan long before their eating disorder developed, that doesn't mean that their ethics and eating disorder haven’t become entangled, which makes a nuanced approach important. “Unfortunately, even if someone is vegan for ethical reasons, they're still vulnerable to diet culture just like someone who isn’t vegan,” she said. “And with all the disordered messages within the plant-based space, which overlaps with the vegan space, it can get messy.” Beasley said it’s important for clients to be able to talk about how their veganism may or may not contribute to their eating disorder in a safe, supportive environment. Also important is preparing for life beyond treatment. “We live in a non-vegan world,” she said. “They need to learn to think and plan ahead, so the eating disorder doesn’t get the upper hand.” Of course, as the dietitians interviewed point out, any type of diet or “lifestyle plan” that eliminates entire food groups — not just veganism — may increase the risk of an eating disorder in someone who is susceptible because of genetics and social environment. This includes ketogenic, Whole 30, paleo and many other popular diets. “If you’re on any type of self-restricted diet, one that’s not medically indicated or necessary for a health condition, and you’re feeling socially isolated, you can’t eat out with friends or you spend a large amount of time prepping food, thinking about food or obsessing over food, then it might not be working for you,” Hultin said. “Any diet can be unhealthy if it’s interfering with your quality of life.” Dennett is a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition by Carrie.

2020-08-17	07:00:00Z	Yahoo Sports		Vegans urged to switch to cow milk instead of soya milk to save the planet	https://sports.yahoo.com/vegan-drink-cow-milk-165113951.html	Vegans should avoid soya milk if they want to save the planet, and even consider drinking cows’ milk instead, a sustainability charity has said. The Sustainable Food Trust said that soya beans are associated with rainforest destruction, and that soya meal is also used in animal food, but that the amounts required to create soya milk meant that cow’s milk is healthier for the planet. Researchers from the Sustainable Food Trust and the University of Nottingham calculated the amounts of soya used in both soya milk and cows’ milk in a new review of evidence. The charity wrote: “Vegans and others who buy milk substitutes made from soya are also harming the planet. “They would do better to switch to milk from cows, and especially cows traditionally grazed on grass, if they want to help make a more sustainable planet.” In the UK, livestock feed manufacturers use more than a million tonnes of soya meal every year, the SFT said. The study authors found that the amount of milk produced per kilo of soya meal varied widely. The authors worked out that around 85 litres of milk is produced in the UK for every kilo of soya bean meal consumed by dairy cows. But no more than 7.5 litres of soya drink are produced from a kilo of whole soya beans – so drinking milk from cows in the UK uses 11 times less soya than consuming drinks made directly from soya. Patrick Holden, chief executive of the Sustainable Food Trust, said: “This is an important study. It shows that livestock farmers could reduce their dependence on imported protein, which is produced at such a high environmental cost, and rely more on home produced feed. “But it also shows that drinking cows’ milk uses far less soya than drinks made from soya, because most of the milk comes from grass. “This highlights the importance of grass, a crop ideally suited to our climate and the grazing animals that turn it into high quality foods we can eat.” The claims have proven controversial. The UK vegan charity Viva says: "Soya grown for human consumption is only a small fraction of global soya produce and many companies now have clear policies in place assuring consumers that their soya is non-GM and in many cases, grown sustainably and comes from countries with stricter legislation.” The charity adds that "the vast majority of the world’s soya – around 75 per cent – is destined for the production of protein-rich animal feed for livestock". Furthermore, a major study by Oxford University in 2018 published in the journal Science, reported that “a low-impact litre of cow’s milk uses almost two times as much land and creates almost double the emissions as an average litre of soymilk”. The study added: “Animal product free diets, therefore, deliver greater environmental benefits than purchasing sustainable meat or dairy.”
2020-05-07	07:00:00Z	Healthline	Alina Petre, MS, RD (NL)	Do Vegans Live Longer Than Non-Vegans?	https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/do-vegans-live-longer	The Western diet and lifestyle are often viewed as two of the main contributors to rapid aging and disease. Thus, many people wonder whether alternative diets, such as the vegan diet, help people live longer, healthier lives. In fact, you may have heard claims that vegans have a longer lifespan than omnivores. The vegan diet is linked to a range of health benefits, including a lower risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and heart disease (1, 2, 3). However, its effects on longevity are much more nuanced. This article explains whether vegans live longer than non-vegans. Research examining the link between plant-based diets and longevity has produced mixed results. One large review of vegans and vegetarians in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, and Japan suggests that they have a 9% lower risk of death from all causes, compared with omnivores (4). Another study examined Seventh Day Adventists in North America. The Seventh Day Adventist diet is typically plant-based, rich in whole foods, and free of alcohol and caffeine — although some may incorporate small amounts of eggs, dairy, or meat. The study suggested that vegetarians and vegans may benefit from a 12% lower risk of death, compared with people who eat meat (5). When separated from the rest, vegans had a 15% lower risk of dying prematurely from all causes, indicating that a vegan diet may indeed help people live longer than those who adhere to vegetarian or omnivorous eating patterns (5). However, other studies in vegetarians in the United Kingdom and Australia report that they’re no more likely to live longer than non-vegetarians (6, 7). Thus, there’s no definitive link between veganism and lifespan. Furthermore, most studies group vegetarians and vegans together, making it difficult to determine the exact effects of each diet on a person’s life expectancy. Therefore, more research is needed solely on vegan diets before strong conclusions can be made. Some scientific reviews suggest that vegetarian and vegan diets may help people live longer, but these findings aren’t universal. As such, more comprehensive studies are necessary. Researchers theorize that vegans who live longer than average tend to do so for two main reasons involving both diet and lifestyle. Veganism eliminates all animal-based foods, including meat, dairy, eggs, and products derived from them. This usually results in a diet that’s rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds (8). Research suggests that diets loaded with these plant foods may help people live longer. The same can be said about diets low in red and processed meats (9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Moreover, vegan diets tend to pack plenty of fiber, plant protein, and antioxidants (5, 14, 15, 16). Diets rich in these nutrients are believed to safeguard against obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and heart disease — which could promote increased life expectancy (17, 18, 19). As a group, vegans may be more likely to pursue a health-conscious lifestyle compared with the general population. For instance, research shows that vegans may be less likely to smoke or drink alcohol. They also appear more likely to maintain a normal body mass index (BMI), exercise regularly, and avoid overly processed junk foods (5). Experts believe that this increased health consciousness may help explain why some vegans live longer than non-vegans (6, 7). Vegan diets tend to be rich in nutrients that may protect against illnesses and boost your lifespan. Many people who follow this eating pattern also make lifestyle choices, such as exercising regularly and avoiding processed foods, that may aid longevity. It’s important to remember that not all vegan diets are rich in nutrients. In fact, some vegans may rely heavily on sugary, processed foods — which could negatively affect longevity (5, 6, 7, 20). Notably, studies that rate plant-based diets based on their relative amounts of processed versus nutritious foods suggest that only robust, well-planned plant-based diets are linked to an extended lifespan and lower risk of disease (1, 21, 22). A healthy vegan diet is typically defined as one that’s rich in minimally processed plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, with very few processed junk foods. Meanwhile, a poorly planned vegan diet may rely heavily on sweets, processed items, and other foods that are technically vegan but very poor in nutrients. For instance, one study claims that plant-based diets as a whole may lower your risk of dying from heart disease by 8%. However, nutritious plant-based diets lower this risk by 25% — while unhealthy ones increase it by 32% (21). Another suggests that improving the quality of a plant-based diet over 12-years may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely by 10%. Conversely, reducing its quality over the same period may result in a 12% higher risk of premature death (22). This may explain why a recent review found that while vegetarians are more likely to live longer than the general population, their life expectancy is no higher than that of similarly health-conscious meat eaters (23). However, few studies directly compare the effects of healthy or unhealthy vegan diets to healthy or unhealthy omnivorous ones. Overall, more research is needed. Poorly planned vegan diets likely don’t offer the same health benefits as nutritious versions of the diet. Nutrient-poor vegan diets may even lower your life expectancy. Vegan diets are linked to numerous health benefits, including a lower risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and heart disease. Some evidence indicates that they may also help you live longer. Yet, like most diets, vegan diets vary in quality. This may partly explain why vegans don’t always outlive non-vegans. If you’re vegan and looking to maximize any longevity-promoting effects, replace processed foods in your diet with whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.
