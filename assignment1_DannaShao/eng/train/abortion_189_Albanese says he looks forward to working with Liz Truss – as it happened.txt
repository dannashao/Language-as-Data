Downing Street frames conversation between Australian PM and the British leader as chat rather than formal bilateral talks. This blog is now closedMarles also won‚Äôt be drawn into making calls for Russia to leave Crimea and restore Ukraine‚Äôs border to where it stood in 1991, saying only that the Ukrainian government must be ‚Äúempowered‚Äù to determine its future ‚Äúon its own terms‚Äù.Marles is also asked about whether Australia will follow other countries and prevent Russian tourists from entering the country.We have a range of sanctions in place and the focus of our sanctions is on the Russian government, those who are perpetrating what has happened in relation to Ukraine, not focused on the Russian people themselves, so this is not something we are considering at the moment, but we are very much a part of the global base of sanctions against the Russian regime.Similar visa bands in Europe have been contentious with critics charging that their implementation binds the Russian people closer to the Russian government by cutting off avenues of escape from crackdowns on dissent.And that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll leave you today. Here‚Äôs what we learned:Prime minister Anthony Albanese says it was a ‚Äúgreat honour‚Äù to meet King Charles in London, but says he hasn‚Äôt had cause to reconsider his views about the monarchy and its value to Australia.Albanese also said he looks forward to working with new British prime minister Liz Truss on addressing climate change and issues in the Pacific, after his first meeting with the new leader.The prime minister also shared new details of the national memorial service to Queen Elizabeth, which will be held this coming week as soon as he returns from London.Acting prime minister Richard Marles said Australia won‚Äôt follow some other countries and ban Russian tourists from entering the country, saying sanctions are focused on the Russian government, not the Russian people themselves.Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has promised his government will redevelop Maroondah hospital and rename it in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, as part of his pitch for re-election in November.While in NSW, Labor has announced a $150m commitment for another 500 paramedics in rural and regional areas in its first term, as it attempts to wrest power from the Coalition government for the first time in 12 years.Residents on Sydney‚Äôs northern beaches are pushing extend the Collaroy seawall to protect homes from coastal erosion and massive ocean swells.And Brendan Moon, the head of Queensland‚Äôs disaster recovery agency, has been appointed to oversee the newly created national equivalent, the National Emergency Management Agency.Thanks for sticking with us today.

Moon joins the agency after having led the Queensland Reconstruction Authority since 2016.Federal Emergency Management minister Murray Watt said on Sunday that Moon would be a strong fit in the new role:Queensland has had more than its fair share of natural disasters in the past decade and the way in which the QRA, under Brendan‚Äôs leadership, has responded and rebuilt has been very impressive.Brendan will ensure the new NEMA delivers national leadership and strategic coordination for emergencies and disaster preparedness, response, relief, recovery, reconstruction, risk reduction and resilience across all levels of government and sectors.Watt said the agency was working to prepare the country for the high-risk weather season being forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology.Right now, officers from the National Emergency Management Agency are rolling up their sleeves and getting on with the job.The forecast for the next three months showed the country moving into a high-risk weather season with flooding as the major risk, over bushfires or heatwaves, according to the weather bureau.Severe storms, intense rainfall, and giant hail are expected to hit the eastern states, with bushfires to affect the northern part of Australia.Art Gallery of New South Wales construction upgrades completedA fritted glass canopy will be the centrepiece of the newest addition to the Art Gallery of New South Wales.Works have been completed on the new standalone building, public art garden and revitalised historic building, which means the gallery is right on track to open to the public in December, AAP reports.Pritzker prize-winning architects SANAA designed the new, open and accessible home for art, sensitive to the gallery‚Äôs beautiful parkland setting overlooking Sydney Harbour.NSW premier Dominic Perrottet said on Sunday that the government‚Äôs $244m investment into the project would help inject $1bn into the NSW economy as well as inspire the next generation of artists:The new building is an architectural masterpiece, befitting some of the world‚Äôs finest artworks and we can‚Äôt wait to welcome the public in December.The expansion was supported by more than $100m from private donors.Kenyan Moses Kibet claims historic victory in Sydney marathonThe top three finishers all bettered the previous fastest time on Australian soil.Kibet clocked a winning time of two hours, seven minutes and three seconds on Sunday, crossing the line just two seconds ahead of countryman Cosmas Matolo.Ethiopian Chalu Deso Gelmisa ‚Äì the victor in the Paris marathon earlier this year ‚Äì was third in 2:07:08.The three Africans smashed the Australian all-comers record of 2:07:50 set by Japan‚Äôs Yuta Shitara on the Gold Coast in 2019.Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigist Girma Getachew won the women‚Äôs marathon in 2:25:10 ahead of compatriot Letebrhan Haylay Gebreslasea and Eritrea‚Äôs Nazret Weldu Gebrehiwet.Jun Hiromichi won the men‚Äôs wheelchair marathon in 1:52.47, with Australian Richard Colman second in 1:53:28.Australian Sinead Diver ‚Äì who was a creditable 10th in the marathon at last year‚Äôs Tokyo Olympics ‚Äì claimed victory in the women‚Äôs half-marathon at the Sydney Running festival in a course record of 1:13:07.Diver was also fifth in last month‚Äôs Birmingham Commonwealth Games marathon which was won by countrywoman Jess Stenson.The Sydney marathon is in the first year of a three-year candidacy to join the prestigious World Marathon Majors.‚Äì from AAPVictoria premier Daniel Andrews has promised his government will redevelop Maroondah hospital and rename it in honour of Queen Elizabeth II.As part of his election pitch, Andrews said the hospital would be rebuilt and refurbished ‚Äúfrom the ground up‚Äù with a new emergency department, operation theatres, day procedure facilities and specialist care spaces.The new emergency department will have an additional 14 treatment spaces with the election commitment costing between $850 to $1.05m.Andrews said in a statement that the Queen ‚Äúholds a special place in the hearts of Victorians‚Äù.Only Labor is doing what matters ‚Äì investing in hospitals, training and hiring thousands of nurses and paramedics and making it free to study nursing.Victorian health minister Mary-Anne Thomas said the hospital will provide ‚Äúmodern facilities‚Äù that health workers have been asking for.We‚Äôve made it free to study nursing and midwifery, creating a pipeline of future healthcare workers ‚Äì so when the new Queen Elizabeth II hospital opens from 2029, we‚Äôll have the workforce we need ready to go.The announcement comes a day after Victoria‚Äôs opposition promised a $400m upgrade to Maroondah hospital, if it wins the election in November.The opposition has previously stated it would scrap part of the Suburban Rail Loop and redirect $35bn earmarked for the project into the health system.‚Äì with AAPSick, sad, or in need of comfort? Young adult fiction can be the perfect balmThere‚Äôs something about a mild case of the flu that has me reverting instantly to my childhood.Usually when illness strikes, I will go round to my parents‚Äô house, get out my teddy bear-shaped heat pack and lie on the couch dramatically, periodically requesting packeted macaroni and cheese or cups of tea.While there, my favourite indulgence is having a bath while regressing to my childhood bookshelf. It‚Äôs packed with my oldest and most beloved classics ‚Äì Winnie the Pooh, Anne of Green Gables, The Secret Garden and the Famous Five.When I fell sick this winter, though, it was the first time I‚Äôd been unwell and solo in a foreign city. I couldn‚Äôt get home to my old books, and I felt vulnerable in a new way. I gazed at my bookshelf blankly.
