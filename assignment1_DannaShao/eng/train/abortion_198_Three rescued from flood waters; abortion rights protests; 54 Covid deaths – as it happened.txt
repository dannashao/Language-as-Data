SES warns of flooding across saturated NSW; airport chaos spreads from Sydney to Melbourne; Anthony Albanese meets Emmanuel Macron in Paris. This blog is now closedWith that, we’ll wrap our live coverage of the day’s news. Here’s a summary of the main developments:Have a pleasant evening.Sydney airport says people arriving too early worsens long linesAs airport queues stretched out the door on Saturday wreaking havoc on the holiday plans of hundreds of thousands of travellers, Sydney airport said people arriving too far in advance for their flight was exacerbating problems caused by wet weather, school holidays and continuing staff shortages.In Sydney, Guardian Australia understands there were technical issues with luggage check-in systems across several domestic airlines on Friday and Saturday, which have contributed to long queues at baggage drops.Baggage drop queues were snaking more than 100 metres out the front door.Read more:The blow dealt by the US supreme court limiting access to safe abortions shone a light on state regulations in Australia, as protesters took to the streets in solidarity, reports AAP.Thousands of pro-choice advocates marched in Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday, and in Brisbane and Adelaide on Friday, demanding free abortions and more accessibility to health services for women and pregnant people.Event organiser and MSI Australia managing director, Jamal Hakim, estimated that up to 10,000 protesters showed their support in Melbourne.What gets an almost 50 year old mostly pacifist to a street protest?The possibility that her daughter may have fewer rights than her grandmotherAbortion rights are human rights Every one has a right to bodily autonomy #AbortionRights #MelbourneProtest pic.twitter.com/xGdMhKGpk8Melbourne really showed out with the weather and with people as well. There was so much passion and solidarity,It was really terrific to see so many people, the State Library was full and Swanston Street was full all the way down. It just shows how this topic brings people together, because it’s about the bodily autonomy of women and pregnant people and it really comes to the core of healthcare rights as well.People of all ages and genders gathered in Melbourne’s CBD as part of a movement sparked by the Supreme Court of the United States (Scotus) decision to overturn Roe v Wade, that has seen 27 US states move toward either banning or threatening to criminalise abortions.Abortion is currently legal in states and territories across Australia under different circumstances. However, in Western Australia, it is still regulated by the criminal code, which has long drawn criticism.Huge solidarity protest in Naarm, standing with US folks and sending a powerful message to anyone here in Aus trying to import this horrific attack on reproductive rights. (And reminding us of the inconsistent and unacceptable abortion access here.) pic.twitter.com/wvdtvnZpOXHundreds of protesters attended Sydney’s rally, organised by social justice activist Hersha Kadkol, who was thrilled to see people coming together for a good cause.Kadkol said:I think the fact that people wanted to demonstrate in the pouring rain is a really good indication of where people are at in Australia, in the fight for our rights.Even though abortion is legal, or off the criminal code, it’s not exactly easy to access because it is expensive and depending on where you are it’s very hard to access an abortion provider.We want to say that abortion should be free, safe, legal, on demand and also without apology because, of course, in WA you still have to ask permission from two doctors to get an abortion at all.Hakim said there were fears of “anti-abortion” sentiment being bolstered in Australia after the Scotus ruling.Thanks for taking us through the day’s news Royce.You now have me, Elias Visontay, bringing you developments for the rest of the day.A few photos of the meeting between Anthony Albanese and Emmanuel Macron.Australia’s relationship with France matters. Trust, respect and honesty matters. That is how I will approach our relations.@EmmanuelMacron pic.twitter.com/Kedte8lKqjFlow picking up in the upper Nepean River now. Approaching 4000 ML/day at Menangle Weir (near Campbelltown) is about 6x normal volumetric flow rate over the previous 7 days. Lots more rain still falling in the upper catchment. pic.twitter.com/4e4ruoLle1That flow at Menangle Weir appears yet to have had any real impact, just 10km or so downstream at Camden Weir. Guessing that might change over this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/tcXN0bQ9zBHere are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records 54 deaths from Covid-19:ACTNSWNorthern TerritoryQueenslandSouth AustraliaTasmaniaVictoriaWestern AustraliaMillions of honeybees destroyed in NSW to curtail varroa mite spreadMillions of European honeybees have been destroyed across New South Wales in an effort to stop the spread of the varroa mite a week after it was detected at the Port of Newcastle.The ABC reports an emergency zone has been set up at Calga on the Central Coast as the number of impacted properties has rise to nine.If the mite spreads it could threaten a $2.8m “bee palace” opened at Tocal in the NSW Hunter region last year.Dr Jay Iwazai, a bee ecologist at the University of Adelaide told the ABC on Saturday the varroa mite is a “small invertebrate” like a spider that “acts like a vampire on bees”.They can’t get them off, they usually are in places the bees can’t reach or the bees don’t have the right behaviour to know how to knock them off. So they latch on and feed and weaken the colony as well as spread viruses to one bee and then the rest of the colony.Iwazai said it was still possible to eradicate the mite before it becomes widespread in order to protect Australia’s varroa-free status but it was too early to tell whether that was actually happening.If the mite did become widespread in Australia, Iwazai said it may help native bees which have been faced with competition by introduced species of European honeybee.It is not an Australian species. And they have done very well in Australia to the point of reaching maybe higher densities than they normally would because they don’t have a pest like varroa.The State Emergency Service has already pulled three people from flood waters in New South Wales as multiple warnings have been issued amid torrential rain.Authorities say they are “nervously” watching conditions as the Warragamba Dam nears capacity and may overtop. If it does, the Hawkesbury-Nepean River could reach major flood levels.The NSW SES has received 240 calls for assistance since 6am this morning.Scuffle at small anti-vax rally in MelbourneA scuffle has broken out at a small anti-vax rally in Melbourne on Saturday with police deploying pepper spray and arresting a man.The demonstration, calling for an end to mandates, nearly clashed with a planned solidarity rally for abortion rights early in the day and by mid-afternoon was moving towards police lines.A significant police presence, including mounted police, was trying to push the protesters down Swanston Street towards Flinders Street.Anti-vax protestors in Melbourne CBD, someone’s just been pepper sprayed. pic.twitter.com/S7DN2MIRTlThe protesters are currently heading towards parliament along Bourke Street.How two cases shocked Queensland into action on domestic violenceWhen Hannah Clarke and her three children were brutally murdered in 2020, a police detective said officers were keeping an “open mind” about whether the children’s father could have been “driven too far”.A year after the ensuing outrage at the comments, just 30km from where Rowan Baxter poured petrol over Clarke and their children and set them alight, Doreen Langham was killed at the hands of her ex-partner Gary Hely, who had a record of domestic violence offences.A coronial inquest heard the police response was “beset by inadequacies”, but the head of the state’s powerful police union, Ian Leavers, originally fiercely opposed a commission of inquiry into police culture and responses to domestic violence, labelling recommendations by the Women’s Safety and Justice Taskforce another “woke, out-of-touch report”.This week, police hit a much more contrite tone as findings were handed down in both the Langham and Clarke coronial inquests. “We are going to do everything we can to be a part of changing that whole system to make sure we do make our community safer particularly for women,” the Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, told radio this week.Experts say these two horrific murders not only shocked the nation but forced police to reckon with internal problems about how they respond to domestic violence cases.Prof Kerry Carrington says:Sometimes there are memorable murders that have a way of mobilising public opinion and unifying a drive for change.These cases really rocked the core of people’s trust and faith in the criminal justice system.For all the details on how two horrific murders have been met with calls for change, read the full story from Guardian Australia reporter Eden Gillespie.Abortion rights protests held across AustraliaA few photos from social media of the abortion rights protests taking place around Australia today in solidarity with people in the US following the supreme court’s overturning of Roe v Wade.Melbourne:Incredible turnout for the abortion rights protest in Melbourne #RoeVsWadeOverturned pic.twitter.com/cV8XLmpPSULarge crowd at the state library in Melbourne to protest against the US Supreme Court decision on abortion law @abcmelbourne pic.twitter.com/WxQYdyFKScWhat gets an almost 50 year old mostly pacifist to a street protest?The possibility that her daughter may have fewer rights than her grandmotherAbortion rights are human rights Every one has a right to bodily autonomy #AbortionRights #MelbourneProtest pic.twitter.com/xGdMhKGpk8Sydney:Despite the rain, hundreds are marching through the streets of Sydney to defend abortion rights @CentralNewsUTS #sydneyrally #RoeVsWade #RoeVWadeprotest pic.twitter.com/584cFpKXkTAdelaide:Getting ready for abortion rights protest in #Adelaide pic.twitter.com/PC9X56egb3Darwin:Pro-choice peaceful protest at Darwin’s Parliament House this morning.

And, of course, our dams and river channels are also full. So, in addition to flash flooding, there is a very real risk of riverine flooding occurring over the days ahead.There are 147 SES personnel ready to respond, with support from Fire and Rescue NSW, the Rural Fire Service, Marine Rescue and Surf Life Saving organisations.
