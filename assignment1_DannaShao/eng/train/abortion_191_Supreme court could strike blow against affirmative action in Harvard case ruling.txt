Court’s conservative supermajority threatens to overturn yet another longstanding precedent as it hears arguments in two casesCivil rights groups, university professors, teachers unions, current and former US senators, and dozens of corporations on Monday filed amicus briefs to the supreme court advocating for upholding the long-held precedent allowing the use of race to increase diversity in college admissions.For decades, the court has repeatedly affirmed that colleges and universities can factor in students’ race and ethnicity in determining which students are admitted, a process known as affirmative action. But as the US supreme court hears oral arguments this fall in two cases against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), following a historic term in which the court abolished the decades-long right to abortion, the court’s conservative supermajority threatens to overturn yet another longstanding precedent.In one brief, current students and alumni at Harvard argued that if the supreme court barred Harvard from considering race as a factor, the university would “miss out on extraordinary students … whose ethno-racial identities were central to their applications and who might have otherwise been overlooked”. In another representing more than 60 businesses and corporations, attorneys argued that businesses “depend on universities to recruit, admit and train highly qualified, racially and ethnically diverse students to become the employees and business leaders of the future”.In another, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC, which represents Asian students supporting Harvard’s case – argued that barring race as a consideration would “hinder universities’ ability to achieve the educational benefits of diversity and harm communities of color” and “undo the progress that has been hard fought and won, and impede progress where it still is needed”.The most recent cases before the supreme court began in 2014 when Students for Fair Admissions, a group that opposes racial preferences founded by Edward Blum, who notably spearheaded the lawsuit that gutted the Voting Rights Act, sued Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, alleging that their race-conscious admissions process was unconstitutional and discriminated against Asian American students.Two years later, the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of using race as a factor in college admissions when it ruled in favor of the University of Texas at Austin’s admissions process in a separate case brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who claimed she was denied admission because of the process. In November 2020, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled in Harvard’s favor.In late July, the supreme court, which had originally taken up the Harvard and UNC cases together, decided to separate them to allow Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson to weigh in on the UNC case.Justin Driver, law professor at Yale University Law School, said the US supreme court historically has shown a “deep ambivalence about affirmative action” in higher education since 1978, when the court first split in a case by Allan Bakke, a white man who was denied admission to University of California at Davis’s medical school. In that case, Associate Justice Lewis Powell took the middle ground, concluding that racial quotas were unconstitutional but that race can still be one of several factors in the admissions process to encourage diversity.‘The court has been hesitant about saying race-conscious admissions programs are constitutional,” Driver said. “At the same time, it has refused to eliminate affirmative action even though it’s been hesitant to uphold it.”Driver added that throughout the years, Republican-appointed justices have “repeatedly resisted whatever temptation they have to impose constitutional colorblindness” in college admissions. Most notably, in 2003, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor upheld the University of Michigan Law School’s admissions program, ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger that because of its “individualized inquiry” into applicants, the program did not “unduly harm nonminority applicants”. It’s a precedent that is now under scrutiny.This court’s conservative majority makeup is distinct from past ones: Chief Justice John Roberts has espoused a more race-neutral approach to educational programs. Notably in 2007, when the supreme court ruled against desegregation programs in Seattle and Louisville for using race as a deciding factor in assignments to schools, Roberts wrote that “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”Theodore Shaw, Julius L Chambers distinguished professor of law and director of UNC’s Center for Civil Rights, expressed concern that if the current supreme court rules against race-conscious admissions policies, the ruling would have “severe” effects on opportunities for Black and brown students, resulting in less diverse student bodies. He called the possibility a “huge step backwards” that would usher “the end of an era in which the institutions can consciously attempt to enroll Black and brown students for any reason”.“Is there a legitimate concern about the willingness of this court to turn away from precedent and not feel bound by it? I think one would be foolish to say that there’s no concern about that,” Shaw added, pointing to the court’s recent decision overturning Roe v Wade. “I hope that I am proven to be wrong.”This article was amended on 12 August 2022 to correct Lewis Powell’s title.
