The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says he will treat Vladimir Putin with ‚Äúcontempt‚Äù if the two cross paths at the G20 summit in Indonesia later this year, but the Australian leader doesn‚Äôt think his Russian counterpart will even attend the meeting.‚ÄúIt certainly won‚Äôt be polite,‚Äù Albanese said bluntly, when asked in a Sky News interview on Thursday afternoon.Fresh from returning from Ukraine, and seeing the damage of Russia‚Äôs invasion first-hand, Albanese again called for the conflict to end and Putin to withdraw. Asked how he would treat Putin if they met in Bali, at the G20, Albanese responded: ‚Äúwith the contempt he deserves‚Äù.‚ÄúIf he does attend the G20, which I doubt whether he will in my view, then the world needs to send a very clear message about how we regard him,‚Äù the PM said.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not pre-empt it ... I will be acting in partnership with our allies. I‚Äôve had discussions at the Nato summit with them about what that would look like, and we‚Äôll take appropriate measures at that time.‚ÄùAsked about former PM Tony Abbott‚Äôs infamous promise to ‚Äúshirtfront‚Äù Putin in 2014, Albanese wouldn‚Äôt make the same bold pledge.‚ÄúThat didn‚Äôt result in much, frankly,‚Äù Albanese said.That‚Äôs where we will leave the live blog for Thursday. Thanks for following along.Here‚Äôs what made the news:Until tomorrow, I hope you stay safe.Two Blockade Australia protesters remanded in custody after being arrested in the Colo Valley say they have been unable to leave their shared cell for 17 days.In a statement, the climate activist group said Timothy Neville and Maxim Curmi had been denied daylight and exercise since their arrest on 19 June.MTC-Broadspectrum, the private operator of the Parklea Correctional Centre, where the men are being held, said only that all new inmates were required to complete a mandatory 10 days Covid-19 quarantine to avoid an outbreak in the prison, but did not comment on the rest of the men‚Äôs claims.Veronica Curmi, the mother of Maxim Curmi, told Guardian Australia that after she spoke to her son on Thursday about the conditions in which he was being held she phoned the prison.She then spoke to the office of the NSW ombudsman, and says she was advised that staffing issues caused by the pandemic and exacerbated by the weather in NSW had meant some prisons were operating below capacity. A Corrective Services NSW spokesperson said all facilities were operating as normal.Veronica Curmi said her son told her later on Thursday that Neville had been moved from the cell.Neville, Curmi, and other Blockade Australia activists will face court again next week.Today I learned that Annie Lennox is the chancellor of a university in Scotland.I was thrilled to receive my honorary doctorate this week from GCU and Chancellor Dr @annielennox.

The case has consumed Bernard Collaery since his offices were raided in 2013. It has now all but destroyed his legal career and practice.For Witness K, who pleaded guilty years ago, at least three psychiatrists gave evidence that the case had been debilitating for his mental health, compounding the post-traumatic stress disorder he developed after his service in Vietnam.But it‚Äôs not just the individuals involved in these protracted proceedings who have suffered. The prosecutions have been the cause of enduring frustration for Timor-Leste, whose leaders repeatedly urged Australia to drop its prosecution of the men.Resourceful #FRNSW firefighters have used a sling and an excavator to rescue a horse that fell into a water tank today at Belimbla Park.

In a society which subscribes to the rule of law, the Collaery and Witness K prosecution sent a message that those who seek to uncover illegality in government agencies will find themselves facing a jail term.Lawyers must be able to defend their clients in accordance with their professional standards without fear of state prosecution.Many lawyers around Australia, acting in the best interests of their clients and justice, make available materials that may embarrass governments or expose wrongdoing. It is right and proper that they continue to do so when circumstances require.Transparency and accountability must always underpin our national security policy. The default position should always be transparency ‚Äì only where there is a demonstrable need for concealment on national security grounds should secrecy be allowed.The Law Council of Australia has called for a review of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act in the wake of the decision.LCA president Tass Liveris said:Secrecy offences must be reviewed to ensure there are adequate protections for whistleblowers and their legal advisers who are concerned about potential matters of illegality.The NSI Act also requires reform to recalibrate the balance between the principle of open justice and protecting the community against the disclosure of information that may genuinely prejudice national security.The Law Council considers the NSI Act currently tilts the balance too far in favour of the interests of protecting national security at the expense of the rights of the accused and maintains that it is not a proportionate response to addressing the risk that information prejudicial to national security may be released.It is the belief of the Law Council that courts should be empowered to identify the relevant considerations and the degree of weight to be placed on each of them.List of warnings in flood-affected areas in NSWHere‚Äôs a handy explainer on where things are with the flood situation in NSW via AAP:About 60,000 people in NSW remain impacted by the week-long rain that has caused widespread flooding around Sydney as the low-pressure system moves north, impacting the Hunter, Central Coast and Mid-North Coast.Evacuation order are in place for parts of:Bulahdelah, Tuncurry, Combo, Whittingham, Scotts Flat, Glenridding, Dunolly, Central Macdonald, Lower Macdonald, Upper Macdonald, St Albans, Wrights Creek, Webbs Creek, Bulga, Broke, Wollombi, Tuggerah, Budgewoi Lakes, Shanes Park, Pitt Town, Pitt Town Bottoms, McGraths Hill, Mulgrave, Vineyard, Lower Portland, Wisemans Ferry, Richards, Wilberforce, Cattai, Sackville, Londonderry, Ebenezer, Riverstone, Agnes Banks, South Maroota, Yarramundi, Leets Vale, Cumberland Reach, Oakville, North Richmond, Freemans Reach, Bligh Park, Richmond Lowlands, Angus, Cornwallis, Gronos Point.Evacuation warnings are in place for parts of:Croki, Coopernook, Forster Keys, Millers Forest, Duckenfield, Colo, Mooney Mooney Dam, Schofields, Windsor Downs, Marsden Park, Melonba, Clarendon, South Windsor, Castlereagh.Major flooding occurring at:Hunter River at Singleton (13.55m, steady)Hawkesbury River at North Richmond (10.5m, falling)Wollombi Brook at Bulga (8.33m, falling)Tuggerah Lake at Long Jetty (1.64m, steady)Moderate flooding at:Hawkesbury River at Windsor (10.77m, falling), at Sackville (8.43m, falling) and at Wisemans Ferry (3.97m, falling)Colo River at Upper Colo (9.06m, falling)Wollombi Brook at Wollombi (10.32m, falling)Paterson River at Paterson (7.74m, falling)Hunter River at Maitland (9.81m, falling)Manning River at Wingham (9.11m, falling), and at Taree (3.06m, rising)Residents can return with caution to parts of:North Macksville, Singleton, Camden, Cut Hill, Cobbitty, Bents Basin, Wallacia, Elderslie, Windsor, Jamisontown, Leonay, Mulgoa, Penrith, Cranebrook, Regentville, Emu Heights, Emu Plains, Peach Tree Creek, Lansvale, Warwick Farm, Georges Hall, Moorebank, East Hills, Chipping Norton, Picnic Point, Pleasure Point, Bonnet Bay, Woronora, Sandy Point, Lake Illawarra, St Georges Basin, Sussex Inlet, Plough and Harrow Dam near Abbotsbury, and Cecil Hills.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says he will treat Vladimir Putin with ‚Äúcontempt‚Äù if the two cross paths at the G20 summit in Indonesia later this year, but the Australian leader doesn‚Äôt think his Russian counterpart will even attend the meeting.‚ÄúIt certainly won‚Äôt be polite,‚Äù Albanese said bluntly, when asked in a Sky News interview on Thursday afternoon.Fresh from returning from Ukraine, and seeing the damage of Russia‚Äôs invasion first-hand, Albanese again called for the conflict to end and Putin to withdraw.

The prosecution ended today.‚ÄôIt turns out there were some questions at that press conference from the attorney general Mark Dreyfus. I have the transcript now. Here are some of the interesting bits.The charges have been dropped and there are no further steps:JOURNALIST: Does this mean effectively that all charges against Mr Collaery have been dropped?DREYFUS: The prosecution is now at an end and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory has been informed.JOURNALIST: So, what‚Äôs the next step then?DREYFUS: There are no further steps in this case. The prosecution of Mr Bernard Collaery ended today with my intervention under section 71 of the Judiciary Act.On the question of compensation, Dreyfus said ‚Äúthere were no agreements and no undertakings‚Äù.On protecting whistleblowers as part of the federal integrity commission plans, Dreyfus says:Of course, there will be a need to protect whistleblowers in connection with the work of the National Anti-Corruption Commission so that people who make allegations, who make complaints to the National Anti-Corruption Commission, who are in fact whistleblowers, they will need to be protected.People that give evidence before the National Anti-Corruption Commission, whether in private hearings or public hearings, will also need to be expressly protected by the legislation.He‚Äôs also looking to implement the recommendations arising out of Philip Moss‚Äôs review of the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which the former government failed to act on when the report was provided in 2016.He would not comment on other cases, such as that of ATO whistleblower Richard Boyle.SA opposition will push to limit use of ‚Äòvisual pollution‚Äô of election postersThe South Australian opposition will push to ban the widespread use of election posters, AAP reports.Opposition leader David Speirs will seek public comment and then bring legislation to parliament to end what he says is the unsightly spectacle of thousands of posters in public places during election campaigns.The proposed laws would prohibit their use along public roads, with limited exemptions for areas near polling booths.‚ÄúAfter a number of recent elections, it‚Äôs clear many people are sick of the visual pollution created by corflutes,‚Äù Speirs said.‚ÄúThese posters and the cable ties used to attach them to poles also have a significant impact on our environment when they‚Äôre disposed.‚ÄùSpeirs said he led by example and chose not to display posters in his electorate during the March state election campaign.He said that move received strong support from his local community.Premier Peter Malinauskas said a ban on posters was not high on the government‚Äôs agenda.But he said it would consider any ‚Äúlegitimate proposition‚Äù.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre naturally willing to contemplate any options put on the table to determine whether or not they‚Äôre in the best interests of democracy in South Australia,‚Äù he said.The big four announced plans to raise their interest rates yesterday, and ME Bank has joined them now, too.Following the RBA‚Äôs decision to increase the cash rate, we have an update on what this means for ME customers.

Hopefully he will also be appropriately compensated, if not honoured! üí™üëäBut full credit to @markdreyfusQCMP and @AlboMP They honoured their word and stood by their values. #colleary#timorleste #jailDownerThrough his lawyers, Gilbert + Tobin, Bernard Collaery has released a statement about the attorney general Mark Dreyfus dropping the charges against him today.Collaery said:I am very pleased that the new attorney general has looked at this prosecution and all it has involved and taken steps to bring the case to an end. This is a good decision for the administration of justice in Australia.I want to thank all of the people across Australia who have supported me and worked so hard to assist me throughout this case. I am in awe of the depth of support in our community for ethical values. I also want to thank those close to me who gave me inner strength.I am deeply grateful for the inspirational and arduous work of the partners and staff of Gilbert + Tobin lawyers, and my dedicated team of barristers, all on a pro bono basis. Their resolute professionalism and humanity has restored my faith in the rule of law. This decision will allow me to move forward with my life and legal practice.Gilbert + Tobin partner Dr Kate Harrison said it has been a privilege for the firm to act for Collaery, which they did on a pro bono basis:The case raised important issues about the degree of secrecy permitted by our courts under current legislation to allow cases involving national security matters to be dealt with behind completely closed doors, even where they involve important issues of public interest. The approach threatens the capacity of a defendant to receive a fair trial.Flights between Auckland and Hobart resumeInternational flights are returning to Hobart from today ‚Äì that is the twice-weekly flight between Auckland and Hobart.The flights were suspended in July 2021 for Covid-related reasons.The home affairs minister, Clare O‚ÄôNeil said:Welcoming international flights back into Hobart Airport, with the support of border services, will encourage more visitors.The Australian Border Force will be on hand at Hobart to welcome visitors and provide immigration and customs clearance.And with the removal of the digital passenger declaration yesterday, flying into Hobart will be much quicker and easier.Also just back on that horse in south-west Sydney we mentioned was stuck in a hole ‚Äì Nine News is reporting it has been rescued.
