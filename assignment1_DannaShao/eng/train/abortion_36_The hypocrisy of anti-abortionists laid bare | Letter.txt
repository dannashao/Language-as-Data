If only those behind the US supreme court’s overturning of Roe v Wade cared as much about children who are living, writes Sharon McIverMoira Donegan’s thoughtful piece (Roe v Wade has been overturned. Here’s what this will mean, 24 June) helped make sense of some of the anger I’m feeling about the decision made by the supreme court in the US, despite being fortunate enough myself to live in a nation where abortion has recently been decriminalised.The last line about how we should grieve for all the women and girls who will suffer because of this removal of their rights over their own bodies was particularly affecting. Yet I am also grieving for those poor babies who will be born into a nation that only cared about them when they were in utero – that doesn’t support them when their father goes awol, doesn’t even have enough formula to feed them when they’re hungry, and certainly doesn’t care if they have to go to school facing the risk of being shot or injured.However, neither this article nor any other I’ve read mentions the thing that really does my head in about the pro-life agenda. The biggest driver of the climate crisis is overpopulation, and without access to abortions and contraception, the chances of human extinction increase. That our survival rests in the hands of a cohort of misogynistic and misopaedic zealots who believe they will be magically raptured to heaven while the children they “saved” drown, burn and starve to death makes me want to scream and weep in equal measure.My only hope is that those children will be the ones to cause the death blow to the patriarchal capitalist hell we live in now.Sharon McIverLittle River, New ZealandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
