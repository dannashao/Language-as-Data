It is expected to overtake the BA.2 strain.It is expected to result in an increase in cases, reinfections, and hospital admissions.The health department said:This is in line with similar patterns in NSW and Queensland. In NSW, BA.4/BA.5 represented over one third of Covid-19 variants in isolates from people testing positive by PCR by 11 June. In Queensland, BA.4/BA.5 is expected to become dominant in the next two weeks. Both states have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 during June.The Department of Health anticipates the prevalence of BA.4/BA.5 in Victoria is likely to result in an increase in cases ‚Äì including reinfections ‚Äì and hospital admissions. This is because the strain has a greater ability than BA.2 to evade immunity provided by vaccination and earlier Covid-19 infection.There is no evidence at this stage that the BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineage causes more severe disease, but the department is closely monitoring the situation.Of the 24 Covid-19 deaths reported in Victoria today, there were people aged in their 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, the health department has said.Now it‚Äôs my turn to rocket.

She told the Today show:I think after so many years fighting to maintain rights and to have access to safe and legal abortion clearly this is going to be a very, very divisive issue in America.It will disproportionately affect poor women, women from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.Gallagher said history has shown abortions will always take place, no matter the law:I would argue they should take place in a legal and safe way so, yes, I can see why people are out on the streets today in America.
