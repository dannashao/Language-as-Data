Joe Biden urges Congress to pass measure that took ‘extraordinary effort’ to achieve. Plus, US centrists to launch new third political partyGood morning.Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has repeatedly thwarted his party’s most progressive ambitions while making millions in the coal industry, has signed on to a bill that would pay down the national debt, reduce healthcare costs and address the climate crisis.The U-turn came after Manchin indicated he would support a narrower package that excluded climate policies. The new bill, named the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, includes “realistic energy and climate policy”, according to the senator, who said it “invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types”, including renewable sources and nuclear but also fossil fuels.The bill is expected to raise $739bn through a 15% corporate minimum tax, prescription drug savings and other means. The Democrats’ compromise with Manchin means it no longer includes surtaxes on the wealthiest Americans.What does it mean for the climate? The bill, which will invest $396bn in energy security and fighting the climate crisis, would cut carbon emissions by about 40% by 2030.Meanwhile … Manchin, who chairs the senate committee on energy and natural resources, has taken more campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal companies than any other senator.Dozens of former Republican and Democratic officials will form a new national political party with centrist policies to appeal to voters disillusioned with America’s two-party system.The new party, called Forward, will initially be co-chaired by the former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey.The party, which will launch on Thursday and has no specific policies yet, has said the key pillars of its platform are to “reinvigorate a fair, flourishing economy” and to “give Americans more choices in elections, more confidence in a government that works, and more say in our future”.How likely is it to succeed?
