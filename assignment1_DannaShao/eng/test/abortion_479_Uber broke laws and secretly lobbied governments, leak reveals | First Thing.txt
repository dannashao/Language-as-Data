More than 124,000 confidential documents leaked to the Guardian expose attempts to lobby Joe Biden and other world leaders. Plus the US cruise ships using Canada as a toilet bowlGood morning.A leaked trove of confidential files has revealed the inside story of how the tech giant Uber flouted laws, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion.The unprecedented leak to the Guardian of more than 124,000 documents – known as the Uber files – lays bare the ethically questionable practices that fuelled the company’s transformation into one of Silicon Valley’s most famous exports.The leak spans a five-year period when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick, who tried to force the cab-hailing service into cities around the world, even if that meant breaching laws and taxi regulations.The data shows how, during the fierce global backlash, Uber tried to shore up support by discreetly courting prime ministers, presidents, billionaires, oligarchs and media barons.How did ex-Obama aides help sell firm to world? Uber sought access to leaders, officials and diplomats through David Plouffe and Jim Messina, who both previously worked for Barack Obama, the leak shows.What has Uber said about the revelations?

Instead, we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”The House January 6 select committee is expected to make the case at its seventh hearing on Tuesday that Donald Trump gave the signal to the extremist groups that stormed the Capitol to target and obstruct the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s electoral college win.The panel will zero in on a pivotal tweet sent by the former president in the early hours of the morning on 19 December 2020, according to sources close to the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the forthcoming hearing.“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump said in the tweet. “Be there, will be wild!”The select committee will say at the hearing – led by Jamie Raskin and Stephanie Murphy – that Trump’s tweet was the catalyst that triggered the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups, as well as Stop the Steal activists, to target the certification.Why was the tweet so pivotal? The select committee will say Trump sent the tweet knowing that for those groups, it amounted to a confirmation that they should put into motion their plans for January 6. It was from that point that the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers seriously started preparations, and Stop the Steal started applying for permits.Elon Musk could be forced by a US court to complete his $44bn takeover of Twitter, according to legal experts, despite pulling the plug on the transaction.The Tesla chief executive told Twitter on Friday that he was terminating the deal, citing concerns over the number of spam accounts on the social media platform.Twitter’s chair, Bret Taylor, responded with a tweet stating that the company intended to “pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement”.Last night, Bloomberg reported that Twitter had assembled a legal team to sue Musk.One legal expert said he expected Twitter to file a lawsuit in Delaware, the US state that has jurisdiction over the deal, as soon as today.How could he be forced to complete the takeover? Under the terms of the agreement the company can ask a judge for “specific performance”, which would compel Musk to buy the company for the $54.20 a share he agreed to in April. Alternatively, the company can also seek a $1bn break fee from Musk for walking away from the deal in contravention of the agreement.Germany is bracing itself for a potentially permanent halt to the flow of Russian gas when maintenance work begins on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that brings the fuel to Europe’s largest economy.

The report by a unit of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that out of 2,310 urine samples, taken from a group of Americans intended to be representative of the US population, 1,885 were laced with detectable traces of glyphosate.Believe in yourself. Be empowered. Show up. Love your body. Stand tall. How many times have you seen statements like these on social media? Or used to advertise products? All point towards confidence: a particular c-word that the modern woman cannot get away from, writes Eleanor Morgan. Being self-confident is the command of our time. At some point in the past decade, women’s media seemed to shift from celebrity mockery and dieting advice to talking about “empowerment”. But behind all the positive thinking, are more cynical forces at work?Nine Britons and one American are reported to have survived after a huge avalanche swept over them in the Tian Shan mountains in Kyrgyzstan.

For years, these draws have made cruises to Alaska the most-booked US holiday. But the journey to those pristine areas, which involves sailing along Canada’s west coast for two or three days, is leaving behind a trail of toxic waste, including within marine protected areas (MPAs), according to research. More than 31bn litres (8.5bn US gallons) a year of pollution is estimated to be discharged off the west coast of Canada.Before she was a blockbusting Hollywood actor and before she was a “clean” wine entrepreneur, Cameron Diaz may have been an unwitting drug mule, she has revealed. In the early 1990s, while she was living in Paris pursuing a modelling career, Diaz recalled a modelling assignment that involved her being given a locked suitcase “that had my ‘costumes’ in it … quote, unquote”.
