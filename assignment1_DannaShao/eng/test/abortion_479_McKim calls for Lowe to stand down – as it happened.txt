We will wrap up the live blog for Tuesday.Here’s what made some of the news today:The Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates for the fifth consecutive month by 0.5 basis points to 2.35%, bringing the cash rate to the highest level since 2015.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has told Labor members “there will be difficult decisions” made in the upcoming October budget, being mindful of the trillion-dollar debt inherited from the former government.Albanese also announced this sitting fortnight the government will introduce legislation to tackle cost-of-living pressures.The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has said a UN report that accuses China of crimes against humanity over the mass incarceration and detention of Muslim Uyghurs made for “harrowing” reading and confirmed concerns held by Austrralia for some time.The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has denied the state’s triple zero service has lacked funding for more than seven years after a review into the system found 33 people died waiting for an ambulance between December 2020 and May 2022.The government’s signature climate change legislation is one step closer to passing the Senate this week with the Labor government agreeing to some amendments proposed by independent senator David Pocock.Solomon Islands PM Manasseh Sogavare has rejected an offer from Australia to help fund an upcoming election, calling it “foreign interference” despite Australia having offered support in the past.Independent MP Kate Chaney has called for abortion laws across the country to be harmonised, noting that women in WA are “subject to some of the most restrictive laws in the country”.The government has indicated it may axe a controversial $18m Australian Future Leaders grant announced in the dying days of the Morrison government.Amy will be back tomorrow with all the latest as we get to hump day for this sitting week. Well, technically past hump day given parliament only sits for four days this week.Until tomorrow.Anthony Albanese has given a speech launching Andrew Leigh’s book Fair Game, which compares Australia’s competitiveness in sport and the economy.Albanese said Leigh used an analogy that Australia’s performance at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, “seen as a national calamity when Australia didn’t perform”, that prompted the founding of the Australian Institute of Sport.He said:We need to take that approach to look at where we are now in so many areas. For example ... 70th in the world in women’s economic participation and opportunity. What’s calamity when Australia doesn’t win gold medals in an Olympic games – it’s an absolute calamity when Australia is ranked 70th in the world as a G20 nation for women’s economic participation and opportunity. That’s why we need to do something about it.Albanese also spoke about the need to enshrine the first nations’ Voice in the constitution.He concluded with some personal remarks, joking that Leigh had helped make Canberra a “Tory-free zone”.Some photos from first speeches in the Senate today via our photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers.The prime minister of the Solomon Islands has blasted Australia’s offer to help fund an upcoming election, branding it “foreign interference”.AAP reports Manasseh Sogavare also labelled the move “an assault on our parliamentary democracy” in a blistering public statement.Sogavare wants to push back the election until 2024, arguing his country cannot afford to fund the poll as well as the upcoming Pacific Games.He is preparing to introduce legislation aimed squarely at delaying the vote.Australia has offered to fund the Solomon Islands election so it doesn’t have to be pushed back.But Sogovare refused the offer on Tuesday, almost a week after receiving it in writing.He described the timing of Australia’s approach as “inappropriate”.“The timing of the public media announcement by the Australian government is in effect a strategy to influence how members of parliament will vote on this bill,” Sogovare said.“This is an assault on our parliamentary democracy and is a direct interference by a foreign government into our domestic affairs.”The bill is set to come to a vote on Thursday.The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the offer reflected Australia’s “longstanding and historical commitment” to democracy in the Pacific, noting Australia had previously offered support to the Solomon Islands.Wong said it was “reasonably common” for the government to support elections throughout the Pacific.Australia assisted the Solomon Islands 2019 election, with the defence force providing logistical support during the polling period.Global construction giants have been shortlisted for contracts to build the first section of Melbourne’s controversial Suburban Rail Loop, AAP reports.Five bids were made to carry out tunnelling from 2026 on the 26-kilometre eastern section of the line from Cheltenham to Box Hill.The Victorian government on Wednesday announced three consortia been invited to submit detailed proposals to dig the twin tunnels.The tunnelling work will be split into two separate contracts, with the first between Cheltenham and Glen Waverley and the second between Glen Waverley and Box Hill.The first contract would be awarded next year, should the Andrews Labor government secure a third consecutive term in November.But if the Victorian coalition triumph at the polls it will shelve the project, worth up to $34.5bn, and redirect funding to the state’s health system.So far only $2.3bn has been allocated in the Victorian budget for early works and the opposition has vowed to honour any signed contracts.Victoria’s independent Parliamentary Budget Office last month released a report that found building the first two sections of the rail loop could set taxpayers back $125b, more than double the previous estimate.The three consortia invited are CPB Contractors Pty Limited, Ghella Pty Ltd and Acciona Construction Australia Pty Ltd; John Holland Pty Ltd and Gamuda Berhad; and Webuild S.p.A and GS Engineering and Construction Australia Pty Ltd.Spiky, enormous and largely unknown in Australia, the exotic jackfruit could soon become a supermarket staple, AAP reports.Predominantly grown in south and south-east Asia, jackfruit has grown in popularity in western cultures as a plant-based meat alternative.When ripe, it tastes sweet and tropical, subtly redolent of banana, mango and pineapple. Unripe, it can be used in savoury dishes like curries.However, jackfruit remains an untapped food source in Australia, perhaps due to its spiky exterior and cumbersome size.A jackfruit can weigh up to 50kg and is the world’s largest tree-grown fruit.A group of food scientists at Monash University has been commissioned by the Northern Territory government to see whether they can make jackfruit more consumer friendly.This will involve repackaging and repurposing the unfamiliar fruit and finding ways to process it into ready-to-eat products.“Jackfruit has so many benefits; it is high in fibre, minerals such as calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, and it is a good source of vitamin A, B1 and B2,” lead researcher Leonie van ‘t Hag said.“It is a good source of Lysine, an amino acid that vegetarians and vegans can struggle to obtain in their diet.“Research also suggests that jackfruit has many classes of phytochemicals that have anti-cancer, anti-hypertensive, anti-ulcer and anti-ageing properties.”The Australian jackfruit industry, based in the Top End and Far North Queensland, is valued at $2.6m.But research suggests the industry has the potential to double or even quadruple by 2025, if new growing and processing methods are adopted.Labor senator Fatima Payman, the parliament’s youngest member, has spoken of addressing homelessness and poverty as her priorities in federal politics, as she gave her first speech this evening.Payman, aged 27, quoted from a Persian poet and began her speech with the traditional Islamic greeting “As-salamu Alaykum” as she told the Senate of her experiences growing up in Afghanistan and coming to Australia as a refugee.Born in Kabul in 1995, Payman said her family fled to Pakistan following the rise of the Taliban. In 1999, her father attempted to reach Australia by boat.“Anxiety and waves of doubt flooded my mother’s thoughts as she waited and waited, for any news of my father arriving safely in Australia. Four months later we finally received the good news,” she said.It was not until 2003 that Payman, her mother and siblings were able to reunite with her father in Perth. She said her family suffered “discrimination and abuse to job insecurity and low wages”, as her father worked multiple jobs and her mother started her own business.Payman herself studied pharmacy at university, but said her hijab was ridiculed at a university class.“Comments like ‘Go back to where you came from’ or inferences to extremism forced me to feel like I didn’t belong,” she said.Payman went on to detail her volunteer work with youth leadership groups, police advisory groups and Muslim student associations. Outlining her plans for parliament, Payman spoke of experiencing grief and depression following her father’s death, and said she wanted to “eradicate stigmas around mental health and make it more accessible to receive professional help.”She also talked of wanting to address homelessness and poverty issues.The prime minister’s office has refused to release the PM’s question time briefing documents from July under freedom-of-information laws, arguing they are not ministerial documents.Ministerial staffers prepare question time briefing documents for ministers, including the PM, in anticipation of the questions that will be asked so the ministers will have all the information at hand.A user on the transparency website Right To Know sought the briefs from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in his first sitting week as PM.Albanese’s office, however, refused the request this week, arguing that the briefing documents do not meet the definition of a ministerial document under the Freedom of Information Act.Senior legal adviser Simona Gory said:Here, the documents were prepared by the personal staff of the Prime Minister and were not intended to be, nor were they, shared or provided to the department (or any other agency).Further, there was no deliberation between the Office and the department with respect to the requested documents.Taking into consideration these finding of fact, I am satisfied that you are not seeking access to ‘an official document of a Minister’ as defined under section 4 of the FOI Act.Accordingly, I am satisfied that your request falls outside the scope of the FOI Act.Senator Tammy Tyrrell has spoken passionately of the need to better support the unemployed and of her own experiences struggling to find work, in her first speech to parliament today.“I’ve seen bright, funny, confident people get broken by a long stint out of work,” she said.“They get humiliated by it. It’s like coming last in a beauty contest, every day. And it’s a kind of trauma it’s bloody hard to come back from.”Tyrrell, representing the Jacqui Lambie Network for Tasmania, said unemployment in her state “breaks my heart” and called on parliament to do more.“When you’re out of work, you deserve help to get back on your feet. You deserve a lift up. And respect for the strength it takes to lift yourself up off the floor,” she said.“If you can’t work, we should be working for you. To make your life better.”Tyrrell, a former staffer for Lambie, called for more “civility” in parliament, and for the nation to “cut us some slack” during complicated debates.“Please don’t be horrible to us here in the crossbench,” she implored colleagues and the public.“It gets ugly when we don’t just disagree, but we take it further. Half the country, represented by half the parliament, thinks the other half isn’t just wrong, but bad.“I want to disagree nicer.”Tyrrell spoke of Lambie’s evolving views on certain issues during her time in parliament, saying it was a “normal” thing to do.“It’s one of the things I like about Jacqui. She’s not the Jacqui she was when she was elected the first time, because she’s not been afraid to learn,” she said.“I want to learn, and I want to change my mind … I like being modest enough to say I’ve learned more, and I was wrong.”“If you want politics to change, you’ve got a role to play too. If you’ve ever criticised a politician for flip-flopping or reversing their position on something – or looking like a dork – or feeling nervous about a media appearance – you’re making it impossible for regular people to get involved in politics.”Queensland has reported 15 more lives lost to Covid and 257 in hospital with the virusToday we have recorded 1,631 new COVID-19 cases.

Tune in on ABC TV and ABC iview. pic.twitter.com/9i14eJJApbAnd here is the disallowance motion itself.This is the disallowance David Pocock is moving to scrap Labor's new super rules the crossbench say waters down transparency including of non political donations. #auspol pic.twitter.com/tbEH3vqbAIAs Paul reported a little bit ago, the Greens aren’t supporting his disallowance motion this sitting fortnight, because it is in talks with the government about developing “a more meaningful and useful transparency regime” around the superannuation sector.But Liberal senator Andrew Bragg is in support:I welcome Senator David Pocock’s motion to disallow the anti-transparency superannuation Regulations.These Regulations will conceal $35 million in superannuation payments to unions by 2030 based on AEC data.The transparency of super fund expenditure, particularly to political or semi-political organisations, must be beyond reproach.Canberra established compulsory super, therefore we have a responsibility as a Senate to maintain the integrity and transparency of the scheme.The Senate can demonstrate that it is beyond reproach by supporting Senator Pocock’s motion.If the disallowance is successful, Australians will be furnished with the complete picture of their fund’s financial arrangements.Even the most ardent super supporters know that this is the right thing to do.Amendments David Pocock requested on climate billDavid Pocock’s office has released a statement on what amendments the senator wanted on the government’s climate bill, breaking it down to what is supported, what he’d like to be supported and what he’d like considered in the future:Following constructive discussions with the government, Senator Pocock expects amendments pertaining to the below to be carried:The annual statement includes climate risk assessmentsAdvice on the annual statement is published before annual statementThere must be public consultation in relation to advice on the annual statementSenator Pocock looks forward to moving additional amendments which he encourages the senate to consider and debate which go to:That the Charter of Budget Honesty be amended to require the production of carbon impact assessments (co-sponsored by Senators Lambie ad Tyrrell)That the annual statement include scope 3 emissionsThat the Climate Change Authority advice on new or amended Nationally Determined Contributions consider best available scientific knowledgeSenator Pocock is also seeking commitments from government:to consider a process that would see the setting out of what emissions reductions are expected of each sector.to review the ARENA Act with a view to removing any risk that funding will go to non-renewable technologies in future.New Labor MP Sam Lim says the “best job in my life” was his stint as a dolphin trainer in Malaysia, as he reflected on his eclectic history – which also included time as a Buddhist monk – in his first speech to parliament today.Lim, member for the Western Australian seat of Tangney, spoke of working as a police officer and cafe owner, after immigrating from his native country of Malaysia.“My family could not afford electricity and running water. We had to chop rubber wood to cook. The floor of our house was rammed earth, the roof was leaky and our toilet was just a hole in the ground,” he said in his speech.His parents did not go to school, and while Lim did, he said he wasn’t able to afford university fees – and after two years working as a police officer in Malaysia, Lim said he became a dolphin trainer in a safari park.“Dolphins are so loving and beautiful; they are cheeky and very intelligent. They can sense our feelings,” he said.“I was very sad to say goodbye to them but I was also happy that they were back in their home, where they belonged, wild and free.”Lim said his spirituality was very important to him, recounting 25 days living as a Buddhist monk in Thailand.“I shaved my head, and took a vow of silence. I meditated and ate very simply. During this time, I experienced absolute peace – peace that radiates from within,” he said.“It is an experience that I still reflect on and find peace in solitude and contentment in helping others.”Immigrating to Perth in 2002, Lim said he again started work as a police officer, travelling great distances across WA on his patrols.Lim said his hero was former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam, praising his support of multiculturalism in Australia.Greens senator calls on Reserve Bank’s governor to step downThe Greens senator Nick McKim has said the governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Philip Lowe, needs to step down after he said that interest rates wouldn’t increase until at least 2024, given what has happened.McKim says while people should not have taken on mortgages they couldn’t afford, they were also lulled into a false sense of security by Lowe’s statement:People absolutely have to exercise due diligence. but I also think that Australians are entitled to believe someone in the incredibly powerful and I might add incredibly well-paid position that Dr Lowe occupies. We can’t allow the independence of the Reserve Bank to be mistaken for a lack of accountability.Ultimately when people whose words and actions can have such a massive negative material impact on the lives of ordinary Australians, they have to be held accountable for what they do and say.Photos from question timeHere is how the Guardian’s photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers, saw question time.He caught this chat between the prime minister and treasurer ahead of the questions starting:Many shoutingAnd Kristy McBain responds to the opposition’s attempts to make her the question time main character.Angus Taylor: if government had the right plan RBA wouldn’t need to raise ratesAngus Taylor – yes, that Angus Taylor – says he won’t comment on the RBA, but if the government had the right plan, then the RBA wouldn’t need to raise interest rates.He says “that is how economics work”.
