Our full report of the day’s events in Taipei is here:China’s military escalation in response to Pelosi’s visit may be influenced by Xi Jinping’s want to distract his country from plunging property prices, as well as a want to “project himself as a protector” ahead of the CCP’s 20th National Congress, according to Jade Guan, an expert in China’s foreign policy at Deakin University.At the same time, Guan said the National Congress may reduce the likelihood of any major conflict as Jinping will want a “smooth holding of the conference”.According to Guan, China’s current military escalation in response to Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is not unprecedented, but how far it escalates will depend on the outcome of the meetings.“We need to wait and watch the readouts from the Taiwanese government and Pelosi’s office which will be important for China to then judge what the level of this meeting is,” she said.Guan said China’s announcement they will conduct live-fire military exercises in response to the perceived threat from the US is not the first.

According to local reports some customers thought the message was a news chyron, or a forthright expression of the franchise-owner’s views. But Uni-president, the parent company, told local media it suspected it had been hacked.“The manufacturer was interrupted by an unknown source to broadcast the message, and the manufacturer was immediately asked to repair it,” a spokesperson said. The convenience stores are ubiquitous across Taiwan, stationed every few hundred metres in some city areas, and central to residents’ everyday lives. More than just snacks, you can also pay bills, accept deliveries and conduct other bits of life admin at the stores.Uni-President, which operates 7/11, has stated that its monitor display system was hacked this morning, causing "Warmonger Pelosi, get out of Taiwan" to appear on displays in all of its 7/11s across Taiwanhttps://t.co/C9GX8IS7CmPelosi also praised the “brainpower” of Taiwan and the success of the tech industry when asked a question from another reporter about the Chips and Science Act, and says “we want to increase our relationship.”“It’s pretty exciting”.Pelosi continues: “We’re not here to talk about mainland China we’re here to talk about Taiwan.”A reporter from Japan asks about democracy and China:“Your question comes amid a struggle between democracy and autocracy. We have to show the world.. to show the world the success of the people of Taiwan. Their courage to become more democratic... a model in this region in those respects... [it] offers a very strong contrast to what’s happening in mainland China.”“Whatever China will do they will do in their own good time,” Pelosi said.“Its really important for the message to be clear .. [the US] is committed to the security of Taiwan... but it’s about our shared values of democracy and freedom and how Taiwan has been an example to the world.“Whether there are insecurities of the president of China relating to his own political situation I don’t know.”One reporter from Taiwan asks if more US high-level visits to Taiwan will take place. He also asks how Pelosi foresees China responding.She replies saying that she hopes that her visit will lead to other visits and notes five senators visited Taiwan earlier this year. “Not too much of a fuss was made,” she said.“I hope it’s really clear that while China has stood in the way of Taiwan participating in going to certain meetings, they won’t stand in the way of people coming to Taiwan as a show of friendship and support.“They made a big fuss because I’m speaker. I don’t know if that’s a reason or an excuse.”Pelosi and Tsai are now taking part in a press conference. Pelosi says she came here to send an unequivocal message that America stands with Taiwan.

Japan’s top spokesman, Hirokazu Matsuno, said Tokyo had conveyed its concerns to Beijing over the military drills, which are due to start on Thursday.
