Thailand cannabis rulesAn article headlined “Thailand relaxes cannabis rules but keeps bar on public smoking ” (9 June, p26) said smoking for recreational purposes remained forbidden and anyone causing a smell by doing so in public could be charged. While such charges are possible, the smoking of cannabis is now discouraged rather than forbidden. Also, it stated incorrectly that only the use of low potency cannabis is permitted; the potency restrictions apply solely to extracts.Other recently amended articles include:World leaders condemn US abortion ruling as ‘backwards step’Prince Charles’s charities are no stranger to controversyWhy is the US about to give away $52bn to corporations like Intel?Putin is not yet ready to end the Ukraine war.
