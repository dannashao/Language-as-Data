Sussan Ley and Jason Clare react to US supreme court decision on abortion rights; Australia to send $1m earthquake relief to Afghanistan; nation records 26 Covid deaths. This blog is now closedSussan Ley: Roe v Wade overturning ‘a backward step for women’Deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley says the US supreme court’s decision to overturn a constitutional right to abortion is a “backward step for women in the US”.AAP is reporting comments made on Sky News by Ley, who is also the shadow minister for women.This has been a step backwards for women in the US. I’m very discomforted by anything that puts a personal and sensitive issue that a woman has to grapple with in many instances, or a family has to grapple with, in the same sentence as criminal.Education minister Jason Clare, AAP reports, said:Thank God we are a country here in Australia where abortion is not an issue that divides the Labor party and Liberal party.I’m thinking at the moment for the women who live in some of these states that are basically being told today that if you want to have an abortion then get on a bus and travel a couple of hundred kilometres.Multiple US states made abortion illegal within hours of the court’s decision to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade judgement. Protests at the decision have erupted across the country.And with that, it is time to put this blog to bed – it was a rather quiet Sunday. Before we wrap it all up, let’s go through the big stories:Thank you for spending the day with us – we will be back tomorrow!I mentioned before that there have been a few comments made online today asking why prime minister Anthony Albanese has not commented on the Roe v Wade decision in the US yet.It’s interesting to note, as several world leaders including Ardern, Trudeau and Macron have commented.Former PM Julia Gillard also tweeted this last night:I fully endorse these words and Michelle Obama’s call to all of us to keep fighting for women’s rights. https://t.co/j7x9ua2NXvI actually can’t describe how beautiful this piece from Ellen Fanning is – just read it:We are hardwired to avoid pain,” he says. “We are conditioned to make any single unfavourable emotion go away. Minimising [another’s experience] is a protection tool which allows people to pretend that the [difficult situation] isn’t happening.“When someone brings up something uncomfortable, we don’t want a bar of it and/or we want to get the other person out of that pain as quickly as possible.”Dutton has told the NSW Libs they shouldn’t be choosing candidates the night before the election – which, to be fair – seems quite sensible.Paul Karp has the story here:Heading up to the snow this school holidays? Victoria police have some tips here:Whilst driving in the snow, make sure you;❄ Drive cautiously with two hands on the wheel and steady pressure on the accelerator❄ Brake with steady pressure❄ Avoid braking when cornering❄ Fit chains to your tyres when advised or if the road looks icy❄ Engage low gear when you drive down a mountain❄ If you hit ice, apply the brakes gently to slowly regain traction❄ At night only use low beam lights. High beams don't work in high mist areas. If you can’t see, pull over, put your hazards on and keep your engine runningTasmania – where even the road warnings are beautiful:#Road Weather Alert issued for Monday morning about all districts in #Tas except the East and the Bass Strait Islands. Icy roads may make #driving conditions dangerous.

Despite many world leaders putting out strong statements condemning the assault on reproductive rights and expressing solidarity with women and LGTBIQ people. Deafening silence says it all.The time has come - State of Origin II is just hours away. Here Nick Tedeschi takes us through the lineup for tonight:Beekeepers across New South Wales could be banned from moving their honey and hives after the detection of a deadly invasive mite in Newcastle.The ABC is reporting the state government could impose the ban as soon as 6pm today, which would prevent any movement of bees, hives, honeycomb and honey.Australia is the only honey producer worldwide to have stopped the mites from becoming established.On Friday the NSW government said it had detected varroa mite in biosecurity surveillance hives in the Port of Newcastle.A 50km biosecurity zone was set up, preventing any movement or tampering of hives, as well as stopping the removal of honey or comb.The ABC is reporting that biosecurity zone is to be extended across the entire state.Agriculture minister Dugald Saunders said on Friday an eradication plan had been launched to contain the mites, but warned if it became established it could cost the honey industry $70m a year.He said Australia was the only honey-producing country to have prevented the mite from establishing itself.There are two types of the pinhead-sized varroa mite – the Varroa jacobsoni and Varroa destructor – which are considered the most serious pest for honeybees globally. The mite detected in Newcastle was Varroa destructor.In 2018, Victorian authorities prevented the spread of the mite after a ship from Texas docked in the Port of Geelong with bees infested with the mite.In Queensland, Varroa jacobsoni mites were detected in Townsville in 2019 and 2020 and then eradicated after an initial 2016 detection.The Varroa destructor has been responsible for the collapse of European bee colonies “wherever it is present”, information from the Queensland Government says. The mites suck on adult bees, weakening them “and new bees are born with deformities”.Wealthy Australians are avoiding paying tax by having the family trust pay children (who will be taxed less), who then repay the money to their parents for raising them.A solid story from Ben Butler here about how family trusts are rorting the system:
