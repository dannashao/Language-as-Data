Organisation says fees for treatment of injuries, MRIs and STI testing for people without medicare would be reassessedQueensland Health has committed to reviewing medical costs billed to sexual assault victims who are ineligible for Medicare by the end of the year, following reports one victim was charged $800 for pathology tests.It comes after reports by Guardian Australia prompted Queensland Health to pledge not to charge sexual assault victims without access to Medicare for rape kits.The acting director general of Queensland Health, Shaun Drummond, confirmed in budget estimates on Friday the organisation would review other medical costs associated with sexual assault – such as treatment for injuries, MRIs and testing for STIs – by the end of the year.These costs would be reviewed across “all other hospitals and health services”, he said.Guardian Australia understands it is Queensland Health’s intention the costs will be removed by the end of 2022.Asked by Greens South Brisbane MP, Amy MacMahon, about the budgetary impact of the move, Drummond said it was minimal in the scheme of the state’s $23bn health budget.“It has a small implication for us that is well manageable within the allocation for our hospital and health services,” he said.The final report by the women’s safety and justice taskforce said the practice of charging victims who aren’t covered by Medicare for forensic examinations and tests had “distressed” tourists, international students, migrants and refugees.The taskforce noted some victims had been unable to pay for examinations, prompting invoices to be sent to a family address overseas which resulted in “gross” breaches of privacy, as well as feelings of fear and shame.MacMahon asked Queensland’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, about abortion access amid reports that women are still facing barriers accessing termination services nearly four years after decriminalisation.Wait times for services in south-east Queensland have blown out following the closure of clinics operated by non-for-profit healthcare service Marie Stopes in Southport, Townsville and Rockhampton last year.Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningD’Ath said there were still issues with accessibility, with the majority of Queensland women having to travel to Brisbane for surgical terminations.“We have been working really hard as to how we fill those gaps,” D’Ath said.D’Ath said the government was looking at reviewing health and hospital services to examine how accessibility for termination services can be improved.“I do want to see more services provided, more accessibility, because we know timing is essential around these issues,” she said.“There’s a lot of complex factors around this … It’s an ongoing challenge.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.
