This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest UK political coverage hereSpeaking at a news conference after a double byelection defeat and the resignation of a Conservative party co-chair, Johnson was pressed by journalists on the blow to his authority, the government’s Rwanda policy and the US supreme court overturning abortion rights.Johnson said of the defeats in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton: “I’m not going to pretend these are brilliant results. We’ve got to listen, we’ve got to learn.”Citing inflationary pressures, supply chain shocks and the war in Ukraine, Johnson added: “When people are finding it tough they send messages to politicians. We’ve got to respond.”He also announced the government’s £372m package to support the UN’s emergency response for countries hardest hit by food security. Attending the G7 summit in Germany in the coming days, Johnson said they will be focused on looking at what richer countries can do to bring down global commodity prices and get the economy “back on track”.Asked about the government’s policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, Johnson said it was “notable that so far no UK court has found it unlawful, and no international court has found it to be unlawful”.Speaking in Kigali, Johnson also said the supreme court ruling that there was no constitutional right to abortion in the United States was “a big step backwards”.“I’ve always believed in a woman’s right to choose and I stick to that view. And that’s why the UK has the laws that it does,” said Johnson.That’s it from me for today, and for the blog. Thanks for reading.Here’s the latest from the Guardian’s letters page.After the byelection wins by the Lib Dems in Tiverton and Honiton and Labour in Wakefield, this is surely is the moment for an anti-Tory alliance. Ed Davey, Caroline Lucas and Keir Starmer should get together with promises to put the planet first, clean up British politics, and get a grip on the economic crisis. No shilly-shallying, Keir. No “we can go it alone”, Ed. Let’s usher in the leader we all need: Caroline.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West YorkshireWhen my husband was in the last few days of his life in April this year, the community nurse asked him if he would like anything changing. “The government,” he said. Well, we’ve made a start. Thank you.Gill GarrattFalmouth, CornwallBoris Johnson would be well advised to remain in Rwanda. There is a splendid modern hotel in Kigali well set up to receive long-stay guests from the UK.Anne AndertonNewcastle-under-Lyme, StaffordshireThis is Beth Rigby from Sky News asking Boris Johnson why he won’t acknowledge that his conduct could be part of the problem with voters.“You’re safe, you’ve won the confidence vote, can you not just acknowledge that?” Rigby asked the prime minister at the news conference earlier."I have to get on with the job".Boris Johnson responds to Sky's @BethRigby's question about the by-elections, saying that he "genuinely doesn't think we should be focusing on the issues of personalities' but be making 'change and improvement' to people.https://t.co/ZTbv6x8cal pic.twitter.com/0ZTcpiTsyBThe minister of state for Northern Ireland said he was “disappointed” by Oliver Dowden’s resignation as Conservative Party co-chair, PA reports.After taking in the results this morning, Dowden handed in his resignation, declaring: “We cannot carry on with business as usual.”Conor Burns said he believed Dowden did not need to quit, and when asked of calls from former Conservative leader Michael Howard for the prime minister to resign he said:I would simply say I will give the same loyalty to my party leader and my Prime Minister as Lord Howard expected of me when he was party leader.Speaking on the double byelection defeat, Burns said:People don’t like elections for bad reasons, like the ones we had in both of these cases. Where we are today is not unprecedented.The former health secretary Matt Hancock has told Times Radio that he backs Boris Johnson, and that the party needs to “pull together” for a general election in which “the only alternative will be a combination of Nicola Sturgeon and Keir Starmer”.Speaking to Cathy Newman he said that “what the results really show is that there is no possibility of a Labour outright majority at the next election”. Hancock said there was “clearly no enthusiasm for Keir Starmer”.On the PM’s position, he said “we had this debate three weeks ago” and given that the PM had won, the party should “move forward”. He added that “there is no alternative prime minister, look around. And that’s just a matter of political fact.”This is from Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, responding to attorney general Suella Braverman telling BBC News it is “disappointing” to see a “dishonest electoral pact between the Lib Dems and Labour”, after the conservatives lost two key byelections.The conservatives think so little of the voting public and assume that they can simply be told who to vote for. God they think they are so superior when in fact this is another example of their extreme stupidity. https://t.co/C0Hn53JCVoHere’s a Guardian graphic showing the Tiverton and Honiton seat the Liberal Democrats overturned:Some insights from my colleague Peter Walker:The statistic which perhaps best illustrates how the Liberal Democrats pulled off the biggest byelection win in UK history by the scale of majority overturned comes from the day before the vote: that day alone, party activists hand-delivered over 40,000 leaflets in Tiverton and Honiton.That is half the entire electorate, and more or less the same number of leaflets delivered as people who went to the polls. Over the course of the entire campaign, the party sent out an estimated 750,000 pieces of campaign paper, almost ten for every potential voter.It is perhaps no surprise that rueful opposition activists on the receiving end of Lib Dem byelection tactics have been known to accuse the party of “carpet bombing” constituents with literature.It was this ground war which, above anything else, gave Lib Dems the sense they might be able to pull off a win in a rural, Brexit-minded seat which has been almost universally Conservative in its choice of MPs for well over a century.The party is well known for enjoying a good byelection fight, and getting campaigners involved and enthused has become notably easier since it stunned the Tories by taking the similarly safe seats of Chesham and Amersham a year ago, and North Shropshire in December.Activists and councillors flooded in from around the country, while everyone one of the party’s 13 MPs – now boosted to 14, from the 11 secured in the 2019 election – made repeated trips to join canvassers. Ed Davey, the leader, spent nine days in the constituency.On both the final weekend of the campaign, and on polling day, the party had 500 volunteers delivering leaflets or speaking to voters. On polling day itself, the party spoke to 20,000 voters.The Conservative campaign, while notably less anaemic than that seen in North Shropshire, saw Boris Johnson and a number of his ministers visit, but struggled to gain the same momentum.Most crucially, as a party which had been able to more or less assume a win in the constituency for decades, the Conservatives lacked a base of activists, both in terms of numbers, and the experience of pushing a tight campaign.Speaking at a news conference after a double byelection defeat and the resignation of a Conservative party co-chair, Johnson was pressed by journalists on the blow to his authority, the government’s Rwanda policy and the US supreme court overturning abortion rights.Johnson said of the defeats in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton: “I’m not going to pretend these are brilliant results.
