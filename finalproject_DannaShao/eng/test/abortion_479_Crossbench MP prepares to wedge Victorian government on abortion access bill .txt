Vote on bill to guarantee access to abortions at publicly funded hospitals could happen WednesdayA bill guaranteeing the ability of women to obtain abortions at publicly funded hospitals could be put to a vote in Victorian parliament on Wednesday after negotiations between its sponsor, crossbench MP Fiona Patten, and the government broke down.It comes amid claims at least one patient a week is being turned away when seeking a termination at a Victorian hospital.Under Patten’s bill, all hospitals that receive public money, including those with religious affiliations, will be legally obliged to provide advice and services for abortions and contraceptive treatment.The proposed changes would also require the hospitals to provide assisted dying procedures for terminally ill patients.Patten met with the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, on Tuesday, but failed to secure a commitment from the government that it would look at the issue after the November election.Given the government’s longstanding position not to support private member’s bills, it means Labor MPs may be forced to vote against expanding abortion access in the state.“Fiona is inclined to force this to a vote now. Given the government’s stance, that means they’ll be voting against it, which is morally indefensible and politically stupid,” a source close to the situation said.“How can you say you care about protecting women’s rights and then stand shoulder to shoulder with someone like Bernie Finn in voting against this bill?”Under the current laws, pregnant women can access abortions up to 24 weeks in Victoria. Beyond 24 weeks, a medical practitioner can provide an abortion if another medical practitioner agrees that it is appropriate.A doctor with a conscientious objection to abortion is required to refer any pregnant woman inquiring about termination information or services to another doctor who does not object.Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningPatten’s bill would not change the right of individual medical professionals to refuse to perform abortions on religious grounds, but would stop what she says is “corporate conscientious objection”.Guardian Australia understands at least one patient a week seeking a termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality at a denominational hospital in Melbourne is being referred elsewhere, despite a willingness by doctors to provide the service.The patients are forced to start the process, which entails reassessment and more counselling, at another hospital.“These women are sent away from the hospital and the doctors and health workers who have held their hand throughout the whole process, during some of the worst days of their lives,” a source said.“It’s treated like it’s something shameful. Women are made to feel like they have done something wrong.”A government spokesperson said it will not support proposals to remove funding from any public health services.“All women deserve access to safe, legal and dignified reproductive choices – that’s why Victoria has the most progressive laws in the nation and a network of metropolitan, regional and rural health services which provide surgical terminations,” the spokesperson said.“We will always support a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices and will continue to work with Victoria’s health providers on how best to ensure all women can access the services they need.It comes just months after the overturning of the landmark Roe v Wade decision in the US, which immediately led to abortions being criminalised in multiple states.
