Abortion ban exceptionsAn article said that the overturning of Roe v Wade by the US supreme court had led to “a swathe of states enacting outright bans on abortion with no exceptions for rape, incest or to save the life of the patient”. While some of these states do not have exceptions in rape and/or incest cases, they do have exemptions where the patient’s life is in danger (US tourist on how she was put at risk by abortion ban, 28 June, p19).Other recently amended articles include:US woman left traumatised after Malta hospital refuses life-saving abortionMāori All Blacks tear experimental Ireland side apart before first TestClimate change role clear in many extreme events but social factors also key, study findsFood additive or carcinogen?
