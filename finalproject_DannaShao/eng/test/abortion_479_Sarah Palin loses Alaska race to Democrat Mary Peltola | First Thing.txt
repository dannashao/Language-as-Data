Peltola’s win makes her the first Alaska Native to serve in the House. Plus, ‘supermajority’ of up to 80% of Americans back climate actionGood morning.The Democrat Mary Peltola has won the special election for Alaska’s only US House seat, becoming the first Alaska Native to serve in the House after beating candidates including the Republican Sarah Palin.Peltola, 49, who is Yup’ik, is also the first woman to hold the seat and the first from her party to gain the seat in more than half a century.

Apostolopoulos was informed last year that he would be awarded a medal for his work rescuing refugees off the Greek coast, but was then told it had been withdrawn, with media reports suggesting the U-turn was a result of government pressure. “If love of country means accepting the killing of refugees on our border, then I’m proud to be a traitor,” he says.Japan’s digital minister, Taro Kono, tweeted on Wednesday that he had “declared a war on floppy disks” in an attempt to drive out the largely obsolete technology from the country’s bureaucracy.
