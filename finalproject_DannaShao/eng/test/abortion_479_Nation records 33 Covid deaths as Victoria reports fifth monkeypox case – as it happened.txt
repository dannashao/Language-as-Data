Here’s a summary of the main news developments:Thanks for following along, and for all those observing, I hope it was a happy start to the new financial year.Have a pleasant evening and weekend.Sydney and mid-north coast facing heavy rainfallFirst up, here’s the area of most concern for heavy rain and possible flash flooding from Saturday along parts of the New South Wales east coast near Sydney.A severe weather warning has been issued for Sydney southwards to beyond Nowra for the next couple of days. 'Six-hourly rainfall totals between 80-150mm are possible', @BOM_au says. An east coast low from Monday would worsen flood risks if it forms.https://t.co/E0A4G0fr0O pic.twitter.com/s5LJkm624MHere’s the Bureau of Meteorology’s rainfall forecasts for Sydney’s CBD (at Observatory Hill), but the totals are similar inland over three days.300mm of rain expected for Sydney in the next three days. (Similar numbers for western Sydney too.) @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/BYKR05M5ZIEven though June was very dry – compared with historical levels and the deluges many in NSW have been used to in the past couple of years – dams remain near capacity around Sydney (and most of the state).In other words, the dams are likely to spill. According to emergency services, Sydney’s main dam, at Warragamba, may “experience a significant spill early next week”, based on the BoM’s forecasts.With the possibility of an east coast low forming late on the weekend, or early on Monday. Here's what the dams near Sydney look like - and why the spills might turn out to be large ones. pic.twitter.com/GeKM0D3Xb5As it is, the Bureau is forecasting a warning for possible major flooding on the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, which is downstream from Warragamba. (About half of the flows may come from other catchments.)In other words, the region to Sydney’s north and west may be in for another sizeable flood, not long after the last one - just three months ago.Read more:A man has been charged by federal police for allegedly attempting to import a gun inside a gaming console.In a statement released on Friday afternoon, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said it had charged a Yangoona man with multiple offences relating to the alleged importation of firearms and drugs.The statement said:The investigation began on 13 October 2021, when Australian Border Force (ABF) officers at the Sydney Gateway Facility examined a consignment from the US addressed to a parcel collection site in Western Sydney.A fully operational Glock-style pistol was found concealed with a gaming console.Further investigations into the matter by the AFP identified the man as the alleged coordinator of the importation, and linked him to the attempted importation of 500g cannabis on 7 August 2021 and 7g cocaine on 26 September 2021.AFP, ABF and NSW police members executed a search warrant at the man’s home on 5 November 2021, where they seized multiple communications devices, fake identity documents and cannabis.Australia win the first Test against Sri LankaAustralia has thrashed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in Galle, bowling the hosts out in a session and claiming their fastest victory in 20 years.After starting the day with bat in hand, Australia took 22.5 overs to roll through Sri Lanka for 113 in their second innings with Nathan Lyon and Travis Head taking four wickets each.David Warner then took four balls to chase down the five required for victory in the fourth innings, handing Australia a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series.More from AAP:Australian shares lose steam, dollar hits two-year lowThe Australian share market has ended lower after giving up early gains as investors remain jittery over prospects of a global recession, AAP reports.The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index dropped 28.2 points, or 0.43%, to 6,539.9 on Friday.The broader All Ordinaries lost 26.1 points, or 0.39%, to 6,720.4.Pressure on demand-tracking commodities such as oil and copper resulted in weakness in the mining and energy sectors, which offset gains in financial, tech and consumer stocks.Meanwhile, the Australian dollar hit a two-year low of 68.25 US cents against a strengthening greenback at 1610 AEST, down from 68.82 US cents at Thursday’s close.Health authorities have issued a fresh alert after a fifth man tested positive for monkeypox in Victoria, reports AAP.The man in his 40s is in isolation after travelling interstate and the Department of Health has begun contact tracing a small number of people.Anyone with symptoms is being urged to seek urgent medical care.Monkeypox became a notifiable condition in Victoria on Friday, meaning doctors, hospitals and laboratories must report suspected cases to health authorities.There has been an international outbreak of the disease - which is rare outside Africa - in recent weeks.Symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, and exhaustion. Monkeypox is endemic in Central and West Africa and has also been identified in parts of Europe.It is usually spread through contact with animals or consumption of wild game.Albanese raises case of jailed Australian engineer with Iraqi leaderThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has raised the case of jailed engineer Robert Pether with the Iraqi leader, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, as the Australian’s family warns he has become “gravely ill” and is rapidly deteriorating in his Baghdadi jail cell.Pether has now been imprisoned for more than 14 months following a commercial dispute between his engineering firm and Iraq’s central bank, which had hired Pether’s company to help build its new Baghdad headquarters. Pether’s family say he is innocent and the trial was unfair and compromised.His family have become increasingly desperate and have implored the Australian government to do more to secure his release.Guardian Australia understands Albanese last week raised the Pether case during a discussion with Kadhimi, a move that drew praise from Robert’s wife, Desree, who said it was a marked departure from the former government’s approach.Read more:North Korea blames Covid outbreak on balloons sent over its border with the SouthNorth Korea has blamed its Covid-19 outbreak on balloons sent over its border with the South by groups of defectors, in an apparent attempt to shift the blame onto its neighbour.After two years of insisting that it had not recorded a single case of the virus, the North admitted its first infections on 12 May, sparking fears of a public health disaster in the impoverished country.On Friday, the country reported that 4,570 people were newly displaying fever symptoms, bringing the total caseload to 4.74 million. Health authorities refer to fever symptoms rather than Covid-19, apparently due to a shortage of testing kits. The North has reported only 73 deaths.The official KCNA news agency said on Friday an 18-year-old soldier and a five-year-old child who had touched “unidentified materials” in the eastern county of Kumgang in early April showed symptoms and later tested positive for Covid-19.“A sharp increase of fever cases was witnessed among their contacts and that a group of fevered persons emerged in the area … for the first time,” it said.Read more:Kiribati is embroiled in a constitutional crisis after the government suspended its chief justice, leaving the judiciary in disarray as experts raise concerns about the rule of law.The move escalates an ongoing controversy over separation of powers in the Pacific nation, after Kiribati’s only other high court justice, Australian David Lambourne, was suspended in May.On Thursday the chief justice, distinguished New Zealand judge William Hastings, was due to begin hearing a legal challenge brought by Lambourne. The suspended judge was seeking initial orders restoring his salary and facilitating his return to the country, ahead of a constitutional challenge to the suspension.Yet rather than begin the hearing, Hastings read out a letter from the government stating that he too had been suspended with immediate effect pursuant to the Kiribati constitution. The remarkable development was first reported by the Kiribati Newsroom.The stated reason for the suspensions of Hastings and Lambourne are allegations of misbehaviour, with a tribunal established to investigate.Read more:Labor and union heavyweights issue statement to mark 30th anniversary of Australian superannuation systemToday marks the 30th anniversary of the country’s superannuation system, and four Labor and union heavyweights have released a joint statement commemorating “one of Australia’s greatest assets”.Former prime minister and treasurer who enacted the scheme, Paul Keating, former Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Bill Kelty, as well as current treasurer, Dr Jim Chalmers, and ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, on Friday said that “nothing speaks more powerfully to the reform courage and foresight of the labour movement than the legacy of super”. They said:Over those three decades, superannuation has grown from around $148 billion to over $3.4 trillion held by around 16 million Australians, helping improve the living standards of Australia’s retirees, broadening and deepening Australia’s capital markets and contributing to the growth of the Australian economy.This was a transformational moment for Australia and for future generations of Australian workers, breaking the back of the balance of payments, turning Australia into a net capital exporter, and reducing the cost of capital for businesses.The statement also calls out the Liberal party for its attitude towards super, both during its inception and in recent times.Their heart wasn’t in it then, and it isn’t in it now.Australia’s universal workplace right to financial dignity in retirement is unique to our nation and is the envy of the world.We must never take it for granted and always defend it.Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 33 deaths from Covid-19:ACTNSWNorthern TerritoryQueenslandSouth AustraliaTasmaniaVictoriaWestern AustraliaFlood-hit NSW regions prepare for torrential rain as BoM issues severe weather warningCommunities in New South Wales that were hit by heavy flooding earlier this year are bracing for days of torrential rain as the east coast prepares for an intense wet spell.The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall for the Sydney metropolitan, Illawarra and central tablelands districts, as a surface trough is expected to remain stationary over the weekend.Six-hourly rainfalls of between 80mm to 150mm are possible, with the warning of heavy rainfall likely to last into Sunday, potentially bringing with it flooding along the east coast.It coincides with the start of school holidays in some states, throwing travel plans into chaos. Authorities have warned residents to reconsider any plans.At a press conference on Friday, Jane Golding from BoM said the focus of the weather system will be on Sydney, the Hunter and the Illawarra, while adding that landslips and flash flooding was also possible:“So we’re expecting some locations over the next few days and even tomorrow could see what they would normally see in the entire month of July fall in one day.“We know that the landscape is vulnerable at the moment and the water can move quickly down the slopes and through the waterways, so flash flooding, riverine flooding and landslips.”Minor to major flood warnings have been issued for parts of the mid-north coast, including along the Colo, Hawkesbury, and the Upper and Lower Nepean rivers.Minor to moderate flooding could also hit the Goulburn and Upper Hunter rivers, the Shoalhaven River and St Georges Basin.The BoM has advised residents who live along these rivers to stay up to date with weather forecasts and of any potential flood warnings.Home Guarantee Scheme’s revised property price caps to apply from todayThe expanded property price caps of the federal government’s Home Guarantee Scheme come into effect from today, with about 40,000 first home buyers and single parents expected to benefit from the scheme which allows them to purchase a home with a smaller deposit.The scheme has been expanded to include 35,000 places each financial year for first home buyers to purchase a home with a deposit of 5%, or, for 5,000 single parents with dependents, a deposit of as little as 2%.The new property price caps which come into effect today have been updated to reflect surging property prices.In Sydney and regional centres in New South Wales, the cap has increased from $800,000 to $900,000, and in Melbourne and regional centres in Victoria, from $700,000 to $800,000.Julie Collins, minister for housing, said the Albanese government is “committed to introducing a suite of policies that will make it easier for Australians to buy a home and deliver more social and affordable housing”.Further information on the scheme, including eligibility criteria and the full list of participating lenders, is available from the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation website.The Albanese Government is helping thousands more Australians into homeownership by expanding the Home Guarantee Scheme.We are committed to introducing a suite of policies that will make it easier for Australians to buy a home and deliver more social and affordable housing. https://t.co/OZUWOylVj1Australia’s acting prime minister has declared the government won’t take any “backward step” in pursuing the national interest, after Chinese state media said hopes of a diplomatic reset were “diminishing by the day”.Richard Marles, who is acting in the top job while Anthony Albanese is in Europe, told Guardian Australia the new government would avoid “chest-beating” about China but admitted there may be limits to what a change in tone could achieve.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday that politicians should “stop making irresponsible remarks”, when asked about Albanese’s comments that China should learn the lessons from Russia’s “strategic failure” in Ukraine.Read more from Marles’ interview with Daniel Hurst, Guardian Australia’s foreign affairs and defence correspondent:Qantas ditches Sky News from airport lounges as ABC takes flight on 90th birthdayIn what is a fitting 90th birthday present for the ABC, Qantas has inked a new deal with the public broadcaster for ABC news bulletins to screen on Qantas flights and in airport lounges.The arrangement means Sky News Australia will no longer be screened in the airline’s lounges, a development that will please critics of the divisive pay TV channel.Read more in The Weekly Beast, including Aunty’s stars party at Ultimo.Ash Barty swaps the court for the fairwayAsh Barty has started her international sporting comeback – and it’s not a defence of her Wimbledon title.As the tennis action continues at the All England Club, Australia’s retired world No 1 is on a golf course in New Jersey playing an exhibition tournament over two days.The Ryder Cup-style Icons Series competition at Liberty National features international sporting celebrities split into Team USA and Team Rest of the World.Barty, a talented golfer who has impressed the likes of Tiger Woods, is in the latter and has so far paired with Ricky Ponting and Harry Kane against American football names including Reggie Bush and Michael Vick.After the first day of play, Team USA holds a 10-5 lead over Team ROTW.The teams are thus:Team USA: Fred Couples (captain), Michael Phelps, Michael Strahan, Ben Roethlisberger, J.R.
