This is the code for Lab 1 of the course Language as Data 2023, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
It should only be used for the purpose of the course and not be re-distributed. 

The code is based on the 2019 version developed by Piek Vossen, but has been substantially modified by Lisa Beinborn.

Structure: 
1)  All the labs can be found in the folder code. Start with Lab1.1-Scraping_HTML.ipynb.

2)  The folder data contains a small extract of the acl-anthology. Load the full acl anthology from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz

3) The results folder can be used to store the crawled data. I already provide a folder structure. Feel free to modify or add folders. Make sure to adjust the paths in the code accordingly.
