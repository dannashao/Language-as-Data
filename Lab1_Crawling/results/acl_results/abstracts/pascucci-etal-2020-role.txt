the role of computational stylometry in identifying (misogynistic) aggression in english social media texts
In this paper, we describe UniOr_ExpSys team participation in TRAC-2 (Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying) shared task, a workshop organized as part of LREC 2020. TRAC-2 shared task is organized in two sub-tasks: Aggression Identification (a 3-way classification between “Overtly Aggressive”, “Covertly Aggressive” and “Non-aggressive” text data) and Misogynistic Aggression Identification (a binary classifier for classifying the texts as “gendered” or “non-gendered”). Our approach is based on linguistic rules, stylistic features extraction through stylometric analysis and Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm in building the two classifiers.
