Wait, what? Steak-umm is doing critical media literacy? Yes, that's right, and they're actually doing it quite well! The new campaign is called ""Deepsteaks,"" and uses the tagline ""There's a lot at stake with deepfakes."" The brand recently released a new video featuring interviews with vegans eating tofu sandwiches and talking about their reasons for being vegan. Through deepfake technologies, these poor vegans are turned into Steak-umm-loving meat fans, much to their surprise and chagrin. The goal of the adulterated video is to make a point about the potential of AI to invade an average person's life, given the tech's recent history of ""being used to gaslight, defraud and sow confusion"" among the American populace, per the brand. With the campaign—dubbed ""DeepSteaks""—the second-generation family-owned frozen beef brand continues its unlikely yet now well-established battle against misinformation in the digital age. And via a related site, DeepSteaks.ai, the company wants to help educate consumers about the hot button issue, asking them to sign a petition to support the Deep Fake Accountability Act and lobby their elected officials to take action. Steak-umm has been doing critical media literacy via advertisements for a few years now. They've pinned a post on their X/Twitter page that contains a thread of much of this work. They explain: This is the official Steak-umm thread of threads to organize our top tweetstorm rants from over the years. topics include scientific literacy, critical thinking, memes, cognitive biases, woke brands, polarization, conspiracy theories, and more. Steak-umm bless. In 2020, Steak-umm posted a Twitter thread that, according to FastCompany, ""offered a sobering string of advice on media literacy, disinformation, and staying informed amid the pandemic."" And even earlier, back in 2018, Steak-umm created another critical media literacy thread that went viral. That thread, according to FastCompany: Addressed social isolation, student loan debt, and generational angst associated with a lack of job opportunity, and a cultural obsession with repackaging of nostalgia into cynical products. I never thought I'd say this, but way to go, Steak-umm, you're doing really great educational work!

2023-11-03,00:21:35+00:00,Soaliha Iqbal,Calling All Vegans: I Tried Krispy Kreme’s New Plant-Based Doughnuts & Here’s My Review,https://www.pedestrian.tv/bites/krispy-kreme-vegan-doughnuts/,"I’ve been vegan for a couple of years now and in that time I’ve pretty much perfected (big claim, I know) re-creating most of my favourite desserts at home, plant-based and cruelty free. From birthday cake to sticky date pudding to lemon meringue pie, I’ve got it down pat, and if I can’t bake it, I can usually find somewhere to buy it (hello vegan Golden Gaytimes). But you know what I am yet to find? A vegan equivalent of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. There are few pleasures greater than a fresh Original Glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut, a high I have been chasing since I first cut out eggs and dairy from my diet. Don’t get me wrong, there are some excellent vegan doughnuts out there — I’ve had vegan cinnamon doughnuts that are better than anything I had pre-plant-based life, and there’s a bakery near my home that makes fresh vegan jam and cream doughnuts that I would sell my first-born for. But a simple glazed doughnut? For some reason, no one has perfected a vegan version of it — and sadly, neither has Krispy Kreme. The iconic doughnut brand released two (2) new vegan doughnuts, and neither of them were versions of the OG glazed. Tragic! And yet, for the sake of journalism, I persevered to try them. Krispy Kreme’s first vegan offering, the Apple Custard Crumble, is a fluffy, round doughnut dipped in icing that tastes like cinnamon and rolled in vanilla biscuit crumble. And it’s stuffed with an apple-flavoured custard. The fruity-flavoured custard sounded weird to me at first, but I can confirm: it works. The entire doughnut genuinely tastes like a spicy, sweet apple crumble in doughnut form, and I inhaled two at once because I was amazed. My professional verdict? That shit is good. The doughnuts are super soft, the custard manages to taste like real stewed apples (so basically, it doesn’t taste like that artificial green apple nonsense), and the crumble on top nails the precarious balance between cinnamon and sugar. It’s not too much of either but has a lovely (and delicious) symmetry. But, I hear you, how can I truly attest for the quality of this doughnut if I haven’t had a dairy one recently? How can I compare the two? Well, I did share my spoils with the PTV office, and my non-vegan colleague Ellie exclaimed: “I’m so surprised these are vegan, they don’t taste like it at all.” Backhanded compliment aside (RIP), I consider this to be an endorsement. As for the Fudge Brownie Bliss, to me this was… mid. I must preface this with the fact that I have never loved chocolate-FLAVOURED things (chocolate ice cream, chocolate mousse) and instead prefer my chocolate to be in the form of a bar (or in desserts I make myself). So I was already biased against the doughnut. The Fudge Brownie Bliss doughnut is also a fluffy doughnut with a filling. It’s stuffed with super rich brownie batter, dipped in chocolate icing and then sprinkled with chocolate biscuit crumb. Honestly, it was just a little too chocolatey for me. It took me three sittings and two cups of tea to get that bad boy down because it was so rich and sweet. It’s probably not something I would personally eat again or buy, but I can say you’ll get your money’s worth — I got three hits out of the one treat. A little goes a long way? At the end of the day, I think vegans will really like these doughnuts, and I personally would go feral for another box of the Apple Crumble Custard ones. But I do want to know — when is Krispy Kreme going to introduce vegan Original Glazed doughnuts? Trust me, that’s what the (plant-based) people want! Oh, I also want to note that the vegan Krispy Kreme doughnuts are sadly limited edition and only on shelves until December 4. After that, vegans, we must fend for ourselves yet again."

2023-11-01,22:18:39+00:00,https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/orin-carlin/,Everything you need to know about vegan beauty,https://www.hellomagazine.com/hfm/wish-list/506404/guide-to-vegan-beauty/,"Vegan beauty has come on leaps and bounds in the last decade – not merely great news for the animal kingdom, but also your product stash. Demand for vegan-friendly makeup, skincare, and haircare has skyrocketed to such an extent that it's actually odd to remember a time when options were so limited. Plenty of industry heavyweights have cottoned on to the consumer trend, offering some vegan products within their ranges, or better still, there are heaps of excellent entirely vegan beauty brands that are absolutely killing it. If you're planning on giving your beauty regime an animal-friendly makeover, there's zero need to compromise on quality. Ingredient innovation and formula development means that there are some high-performing vegan beauty products out there that stand head and shoulders above their non-vegan counterparts. Vegan beauty means products that contain no animal derivatives (including ingredients such as beeswax and lanolin), whereas cruelty-free (identified most commonly with the Leaping Bunny accreditation) means a product was developed without animal testing, and it is not sold in countries where animal testing is mandatory. Animal testing for cosmetic purposes is banned in the UK, and also under EU law. Prior to May 2021, 'general' cosmetics sold in China were subjected to mandatory pre-market animal testing, meaning that beauty brands that sold to the Chinese market could not be classified as cruelty-free. Since then, ""the prerequisite for pre-market animal testing has been lifted for most cosmetics being sold in the country"", according to Cruelty-Free Kitty. Most brands helpfully label their vegan beauty products as such on the outer packaging. However, if it's not obvious, or if you're simply wanting to double check, there are certain red-flag ingredients that signal a non-vegan product. A few to look out for include lanolin (derived from sheep's wool, found in some lip balms), honey and beeswax, and carmine (a red pigment derived from insects, found in some lipsticks). We recommend you refer to a brand's website if you're unsure, because even some commonplace skincare ingredients are non-vegan. Squalane for instance is harvested from the liver of sharks - granted this is much less common nowadays given developments in plant-based formulas - but it is still worth checking. The nature of my job as a fashion and beauty journalist requires me to be super discerning, testing new products and putting them through their paces. All the beauty brands I've chosen are fully vegan across the board, and the products I've highlighted are a few of my personal favourites. Hello! Fashion shares our favourite vegan beauty brands: With its aesthetically pleasing packaging and kind spirit ethos, Selena Gomez’s brainchild Rare Beauty is brilliant, and entirely vegan. I really rate the Perfect Strokes Volumizing Mascara (think the ultimate all-in-one lash transformer), but my current obsession is the All of the Above Weightless Eyeshadow Stick. It is a godsend on days when I'm limited on time, simply swipe it over the lid and along the lower lash line and blend. It takes seconds. Plus, unlike a few other formulas I've tried, it refuses to budge. I'm wedded to 'Adventure', a lovely deep gold. Sadly, this particular shade seems to always be unavailable - stock up if you spot it - but the champagne-hued 'Integrity' is also very pretty. With self-expression at its core, NYC-based Milk Makeup has a fun, youthful spirit. It's one of the more affordable brands that I think excels in non-sticky, super cushiony cream formulas – plus, it has an excellent selection of miniatures. You'd be hard pressed to find me flying without a Milk Makeup stick in my hand luggage. I've lost count of how many Lip + Cheek sticks I've bought over the years for friends and family. Universally flattering and a total breeze to apply, 'Werk' – a pretty, dusty rose – is my go-to when I need a healthy flush of colour. Created by celebrity facialist Sharon McGlinchey, small-batch Australian brand MV Skintherapy strips things back to basics and focuses on the ritual of self-care. The brand's oils are utterly lovely, and I am particularly fond of its rose line for both nourishment and hydration - great on dull, weathered skin. Fresh and fragrant, MV Skintherapy's Rose Hydrating Mist is uplifting and moisturising in equal parts. Packed with the humectant glycerin and a sumptuous blend of rose-derived oils, the formula is great for delivering a hit of hydration after the liquid exfoliant stage. I personally remain unpersuaded by the 'clean beauty' movement, but another vote for Australian vegan skincare comes in the form of Inika Organic. With quality ingredients and the pursuit of radiance at its core, the brand boasts a thoughtful, user-friendly lineup of products at a reasonable mid-range price point. Loaded with bakuchiol, a plant-derived retinol alternative, this formula by Inika Organic is feather-light, suitable for those with sensitivity and leaves my dry skin feeling comfortable and nourished. It's marketed as a serum, but I do find it oily enough that I often don't follow up with moisturiser. Unsurprisingly, Princess Diana was onto something when she recruited hair extraordinaire Sam McKnight as her personal stylist. His entirely vegan brand Hair by Sam McKnight is all about the cool-girl aesthetic, captured best by 90s muse Kate Moss. Not sure where to start? Try out the brand's Lazy Girl Dry Shampoo – indispensable on clean hair days when you need a serious volume boost. It's not chalky in the slightest and leaves no maddening white residue. Plus, the fragrance - and this checks out across the whole product line-up - is utterly divine. Aveda is one of the globe's leading haircare brands, and for excellent reason. Marrying performance and innovation with an earth-friendly outlook, the brand has been cruelty-free since its inception in 1978. After extensive fine-tuning, Aveda has reworked its first-rate formulas so it is now fully vegan. Aveda's Scalp Solutions range is excellent - vital for those who suffer with buildup or general discomfort. The conditioner and the mist could just as easily have made the cut, but I opted for the shampoo because I can't get over how refreshed and whistle-clean it makes my scalp feel - even when I've had lots of product in my hair - without it ever verging into 'squeaky' territory. I always favour professional-standard nail brands, and Mylee is one of my favourites for affordable gels. Founded in 2014, it is a trailblazer in the at-home salon sphere with its ultra-durable polishes. (Truly, if you have slow nail growth like me, a DIY pedicure can last for a month.) Mylee offers some extremely good value kits as well as an extensive individual shade range. I'm devoted to jewel tones, and I adore 'Green Velvet' - a lovely, rich emerald. A total no brainer if you're wanting to cut back on the amount you spend on beauty services. A relative newcomer as far as luxury perfume houses go, Sana Jardin was only founded in 2017 and yet it has already made a huge splash. Blending natural and man-made notes, the brand prides itself on delivering ""the exquisite, lush beauty of nature’s most exotic scents with sparkling clarity and presence"". Berber Blonde is zingy and invigorating, but this season I can't get enough of Celestial Patchouli's smoky depth. Exuding cashmere-level warmth, it feels autumn-appropriate and slightly hypnotic. Beauty maven Michelle Feeney created independent British label Floral Street with the intention of making the world of fragrance more ""accessible and affordable"". Unpretentious and excellent value, get acquainted with the London-inspired scents via the discovery set if you're looking for a new signature. Lush and inviting, London Poppy combines a hit of juiciness – Sicilian lemon and Florida orange – with creamy notes of blossom and heady jasmine. Like this story? Sign up to our Hello!

The water in Philadelphia, he insists, gives the bread a distinctive taste and consistency. Then it’s important to get the right cut of meat and prepare it a certain way with the right seasoning. Hayes’ formula is a patented blend of 13 herbs and spices. Like Colonel Harland Sanders, who kept his recipe for the 11 herbs and spices of Kentucky Fried Chicken in a vault in Louisville, Hayes keeps his recipe in a vault. The only person he’s shared it with is Aisha “Pinky” Cole, his wife and fellow entrepreneur who created the Slutty Vegan restaurant chain and brand. Hayes, 36, was inspired to launch his Big Dave’s Cheesesteaks chain after tasting what passed for a “Philly” when he moved to Atlanta. He chose the name “Big Dave” to honor his father, who died of lung cancer in 2009. He credits his grandfather with teaching him how to make the iconic sandwich. The Grammy Award-winning rapper and actress Eve, a Philadelphia native, put Big Dave’s on the map when she stopped by the gas station where he’d set up shop to try a sandwich and then raved about it to her fans on social media. Says Hayes: “The next day, I had lines out the door.” He met Cole in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in 2020, when protestors broke the windows of his flagship location in downtown Atlanta and she reached out through Instagram to ask if he needed help. He declined help but asked to meet and immediately felt that he’d met his soul-mate. “I can remember sitting there and I was looking at her, looking at myself because she was a reflection of me,” he says. “My beliefs, my wants, my dreams, my hopes, my needs, everything was hitting right on there.” Now, with seven stores to his name and another on the way in Charlotte, North Carolina, Hayes is about to announce a 10-store deal to start franchising the brand in “a state where oranges grow.” He is talking to several potential partners about expanding nationwide, with plans to get to 100 units within one to two years. He’s also partnering with Cole on new products and philanthropic projects. “What makes me feel good when I get a kid that walks up to me and says they changed their life because of me or they got out of the streets because of me or they want to do so many great things in the world because of me,” says Hayes. For more insights on how Hayes built his brand and his road map for what’s next, click on the video above."
2023-11-01,14:22:00+00:00,https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/orin-carlin/,Best designer vegan handbags of 2023,https://www.hellomagazine.com/hfm/506365/best-vegan-designer-handbags/,"Once upon a time, a quality designer bag meant one thing, and one thing only: leather. Now, the animal-derived fabric no longer necessarily represents the pinnacle of luxury goods. In fact, there are plenty of excellent vegan designer brands that are making waves in the accessory market. For one, Los Angeles-based JW Pei has made a huge impression with its cult Gabbi shoulder bags, having been spotted on the likes of Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber and Emily Ratajkowski. Securing that much-coveted supermodel seal of approval has propelled JW Pei to new heights, and so it's no wonder that many more designers are looking to get on board and cater for those wanting to avoid animal-derived materials. Vegan handbags are made from a variety of materials, with faux leather being one of the main alternatives. Most vegan leather is made from polyurethane, a polymer usually derived from petroleum. Many brands are now experimenting with plant-derived alternatives, including 'leather' created from cactus, apple and pineapple waste. The Stella McCartney label has never used leather, feathers, fur or skin within its collections, but it is not vegan. Some of its pieces contain animal-derived materials, silks and wools for instance. However, the brand is committed to innovation, and is constantly working on developing new materials. Its 'Frame Mylo' design - marketed as the world’s first-ever luxury handbag - is created from mycelium, the root-like structures of fungi. Hello! Fashion shares the best designer vegan handbags to shop now: This bio-derived vegan leather bag by Mashu is giving vintage glam with a contemporary twist. I love the warmth of the plated brass hardware and the pretty, sculptural clasp detailing. Glossy and luxe, this wine-hued clutch by Thermoirè feels categorically autumn-appropriate. Crafted from polyurethane, the piece includes a detachable shoulder strap and the pleat detailing adds a sense of texture. Flashy and playful, JW Pei's 'Jana' piece is giving major party season vibes if you're looking to swerve the sparkle and instead lean into the metallics. The cut-out detailing feels contemporary and cool, and it would look great with a wash of highlighter across your cheekbones. For a dose of glitz, look no further than Giarité's 'Brilly' design. Adored by fashion editors, the bucket bag shape has a certain effortlessness about it, and I love the rhinestones for a hit of Y2K appeal. Featuring a slouchy, knotted silhouette, Nanushka's 'Jen' bag is the minimalist's idea of accessory heaven. It's roomy enough to fit all your essentials, plus the camel hue feels super wearable. Created from croc-effect vegetarian leather derived from apple waste, this chocolate brown crossbody by Stella McCartney is perfect for every day. Style over a fluffy knit or a glossy trench. Sleek and versatile, DeMellier's signature 'Nano Montreal' bag now comes in vegan leather. With a structured top handle design, the piece feels smart and classic, and I love the timelessness of the hardware for a look that feels non-logocentric. Like this story? Sign up to our Hello!

And when you find out why we guarantee that you’ll be pleasantly surprised. Meet the new iteration of the famed Gucci Horsebit 1955 bag made from Demetra - AKA vegan leather, with vocal vegan and animal rights activist Billie Eilish as the innovative bag's poster girl. To put it simply, It’s Gucci’s answer to the future of fashion. Soft, durable and made in-house with 75% plant-derived raw materials, Demetra is the latest innovation in animal-free material from the Italian house. The material has been in the works since 2021, but this is the first time we’ve seen it used for its intended purpose, and actually going live for customers to buy. To celebrate the milestone of innovation Gucci called upon muse and friend of the house Billie to front the campaign, showcasing the new bag in all its Gucci glory. The official campaign video shows Billie hanging about in different locations being herself. With the pop-stars Barbie movie track ‘What Was I Made For?’ setting the tone, Billie can be seen goofing around, swinging on swings, riding in pick-up trucks and playing the keyboard all whilst dressed head to toe in enviable Gucci fits. The imagery is much the same, with Billie exuding authenticity as she poses with her guitars and pulls faces to the camera. This isn’t the first time the two have collaborated together, just last year the Bad Guy singer was the face of Gucci’s Eyewear campaign, donned in over-the-top frames whist driving a vintage car. Eilish is also known for favouring the Gucci monogram in matching two-piece sets on red carpets around the world. Although the Horsebit 1955 bag is the first to be reimagined in the Demetra fabric, we have a sneaky suspicion that it won’t be their last…"

So popular is it now that even dedicated meat-eaters are keenly pouring over the courses with the little “V” beside them. Even McDonald’s is getting in on the act. And so: there’s no shortage of choice for fully vegan and vegetarian restaurants in the capital. The question is no longer “where?” but “which?” and for the past few years, @thisvegancity have been pulling together their favourite finds. Here, the two hungry vegans behind the guide, Laura Pearson and Emma Ewbank, have narrowed down their tried-and-tested list of the best vegan restaurants in London to their 25 favourites. Tuck in. Put the Deliveroo app down, get out of your trackies, put on something fancy and get ready for a truly special dining experience at Gauthier Soho. Alexis Gauthier, known for his work on MasterChef and who for years held a Michelin star at his eponymous restaurant, confessed his midlife crisis could have resulted in him purchasing a Harley Davidson but, instead, he decided to go vegan and turn his already successful fine dining restaurant into something fully plant-based. With a 10-course tasting menu, expect to be wowed. 12 Romilly Street, W1, gauthiersoho.co.uk In the heart of the City, with its clean, light, Danish-inspired interior, this restaurant plucks flavours from around the world. Start your journey with the fluffy kimchi pancakes, a Korean favourite, then take a trip to Morocco with a harissa-grilled tofu steak tagine, or opt for the Sri Lankan golden curry, before finishing with an induglent dairy-free affogato. 60 Bartholomew Close, EC1, stemandglory.uk/london Here’s another hit from the vegan man of the moment, Alexis Gauthier, but one that doesn’t quite pull on the purse strings as much as his fine dining restaurant. This breakfast and lunch cafe and, most excitingly, sushi bar is in the basement and on the terrace of department store of Fenwick’s of Bond Street. It works all kinds of magic with beetroot and carrots, creating remarkably realistic looking tuna and salmon sashimi pieces that also taste the part. If faux-fish is not for you, fear not; there is a bounty of brunch options that are equally delicious. Lower ground floor, Fenwick of Bond Street, 63 New Bond Street, W1, 123vegan.co.uk Vegan hero, BLM activist and reasonably fast driver Lewis Hamilton has backed this neat little chain of burger bars dotted around London. The decor screams “Instagrammable” with plants and neon lights, and the menu is 100 per cent riffing off McDonald's, but if fast-food is what you are after, it doesn’t really come better than this. Using the Beyond Meat range for their Big Stack, Chick’n patties or nuggets, hot dog and Filet-No-Fish, all your junk cravings will be satisfied here. Across Lonon, neat-burger.com If you want to rub shoulders with a vegan celeb or two, Om Nom is the place. This Islington restaurant, which also has a mindfulness and yoga studio, counts numerous stars among its patrons. For every meal or yoga class you attend, Om Nom will donate money to feeding a child a hot, healthy nutritionally balanced meal in the developing world. It helps that the Eastern-inspired cuisine is damn good, too. Islington Square, 116N Upper Street, N1, omnom.com Bursting onto the vegan scene only a couple of years ago, set up by YouTube star Mikey Pearce and Made in Chelsea’s Verity Bowditch, Clean Kitchen Club started by delivering food during the pandemic. It now has a bricks and mortar base in Camden as well as outposts in Battersea Power Station, Notting Hill, Soho and Wembley. The meatball wrap is our favourite, with other menu options including burgers, katsu bowls, mac ‘n’ cheese, doughnuts and more.

2023-11-01,10:08:31+00:00,Ruth Schuster,Archaeologists discover earliest use of vegan dye in Israeli cave,https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/2023-11-01/ty-article/archaeologists-discover-earliest-use-of-vegan-dye-in-israeli-cave/0000018b-8a21-d570-a99b-9a2ba9790000,"At Kebara 15,000 years ago, plant-based pigment was used to dye beads and, possibly, wow the other Natufians, archaeologists suggest Humans were using paint before our species even emerged. Colorful clays, mostly red ochers but also yellow and brown, have been found in archaeological contexts from deep prehistory, over half a million years ago. By about 140,000 years ago, archaeologists agree that its use by various human species, whether to paint the cave or the person, had become habitual. All that refers to subdued “earth pigments,” ocher and other minerals. Now, at Kebara Cave in northern Israel, archaeologists report on the earliest known use of vegan dye: a bright red derived from the roots of flowering plants in the Rubia family 15,000 years ago. This plant-based dye was detected on 10 beads made of shell that had been discovered almost a century ago, Laurent Davin of the Hebrew University with Ludovic Bellot-Gurlet of the CNRS and Julien Navas of Paris’ National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts report in PLOS ONE. The source of the dye was roots of Rubiaceae – known in some places as woodruff or madder – a plant common throughout Eurasia that is characterized by small white flowers. Which people discovered that bright red dye could be made from the roots of plants with small white flowers? Hunter-gatherers associated with the Early Natufian culture in Israel, a pre-Neolithic people who were already settling down. In fact, they were among the earliest sedentary hunter-gatherers in the Levant. The source of the beads from Kebara was a collection kept in Israel from the original excavation in 1931. Other items unearthed in that excavation are held in collections in the United States and Britain, Davin says. The source of the notion that there was something unusual about the Natufian beads at Kebara, as opposed to all other Natufian beads (of which over 10,000 have been found), was Davin’s observation that their red hue was startlingly bright. The Natufians, whose culture spanned about 15,000 to 11,500 years ago, were pre-agricultural. They had no domestic crops or animals aside from dogs, which they definitely did have. And mice. Natufian settlements from 15,000 years ago were graced with the domestic house mouse – probably not as companions or pets, but the rodents’ presence in Natufian contexts is also taken as evidence of their sedentarism, Davin explains. Also supporting the theory of their sedentarism is animal remains from all seasons: these people lived in Kebara year-round, Davin adds. Ocher is amply found in the Natufian context: for instance, at el-Wad Cave, just 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) as the bird flies from Kebara; and Hilazon Cave, which contains Natufian burials involving textiles colored with ocher. The mineral dye has also been found in Natufian burials at Azraq, Jordan – where the people may have dyed the skulls of their dead in red. But this is the first discovery of plant dyes this early, or in Natufian contexts. The earliest-known plant dye (or animal-based dye) before this dates to about 6,000 years ago. Plants of the Rubia family are not edible, hence the discovery of dye derived from its roots reveals a previously unknown behavioral aspect of Natufian society: non-dietary plant processing, the authors say. Since they likely weren’t eating an inedible plant, how did the Natufians discover this colorful property of its roots? “It’s still used to this day in traditional medicine purposes,” Davin says. It has antioxidant properties, he notes, and is also used as a purported aphrodisiac. Perhaps it was exploited in the name of loving, if not as a foodstuff per se, and maybe that helps explain the discovery related to its roots. “The Natufians probably tried many things. They looked at the whole environment, looking for things to use,” he suggests. They tested this, experimented with that and wound up with a bright red dye that outshone any hue from the mineral world. Asked why Davin and colleagues revisited beads found in 1931, he explains that he observed they were exceptional. “The red here looks really red. It looks nearly like blood,” he says. No other Natufian site features beads like these, which could indicate that it was a local innovation – or it could be an artifact of preservation. We humans do like bright shiny things. Like ravens, aren’t we. Even hominins apparently did, going by prehistory collections of crystals going back over 100,000 years. In any case, these Kebaran beads were very red – which may have impressed the others no end, because of the psychological “red effect,” the authors posit. “Wearing red enhances one’s dominance, aggressiveness, and testosterone level, facilitating competitive positive outcomes,” the authors write. “In psychology studies, we know there is a ‘red effect’ on the human brain and cognitive outcomes,” Davin explains. There is? Check out sports teams – their jerseys aren’t chartreuse. “Wearing red shirts has an effect on the game. Red is really important to human brains.” Also, in the mating game – red is widely deemed attractive, he adds. We add that a great deal of prehistoric artistic endeavor used red ocher, but then ocher doesn’t occur in cerulean or Barbie pink. Anyway, the team notes the theory that the “red effect” may explain why prehistoric people and even non-sapiens hominins used red ocher to decorate their spaces and selves. One other thing. Kebara is near the Mediterranean Sea, and indeed that sea is the source of most of the shells there. But a lot also came from the Red Sea and even Turkey. “It probably shows they had social links with distant Natufian groups, very far away,” Davin suggests."

2023-10-30,16:15:00+00:00,Joanna Thompson,People Are Feeding Their Cats Vegan Pet Food. Hmmm!,https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/vegan-cat-dog-food-nutrients-is-it-ok.html?via=rss,"Like many pet owners, Zoe and her husband feed their cat a scoop of dry food every day. But unlike most pet owners, the kibble they give their kitty isn’t made of meat—instead, it’s entirely plant-based. “I kept very quiet about it at first,” she says. You just never know how people are going to react to your dietary choices, even (or maybe especially) when those choices involve what you feed your pet. Zoe, who requested to be identified by first name only to avoid online harassment, is part of a small but growing number of cat owners opting to feed their furry companions vegan kibble. These pet parents cite a wide range of concerns—from the environmental impact of meat to animal welfare to their pets’ health—as reasons for making the switch to VGRRR’s plant-based wet food, or Benevo’s Pawtato treats. The rise of vegan cat food has drawn sharp criticism from animal welfare organizations, including the ASPCA. Some folks even assert that feeding your cat a vegan diet is tantamount to animal abuse. These opposing viewpoints have sparked fierce feline debate, and researchers who study animal health are left attempting to catch up with the trend. Cat chow typically contains a slurry of slaughterhouse byproducts: organs like livers, kidneys, and lungs, as well as bits of the finer cuts, such as leg muscle. That’s mixed with pureed grains, vitamins, minerals, and veggies. The whole concoction gets extruded through a machine that pressure-cooks it into bite-sized, cereallike bits. Whether or not you personally enjoy eating meat, the idea of feeding your beloved pet unidentifiable animal parts can be kind of upsetting if you think about it too hard. But those meat scraps are providing your kitty with absolutely essential nutrients. “Cats are what we call ‘obligate carnivores,’ ” says Andrea Harvey, a veterinarian at the University of Technology Sydney. “They physiologically have to eat meat.” Specifically, cats need nutrients like taurine and certain fatty acids, which are abundant in animal flesh, because their bodies can’t synthesize them on their own. Humans, in contrast, are omnivores. If we cut chicken and steak from our diets, our systems can cobble together meat-specific nutrients from bits and pieces of molecules found in other foods. Taurine-deficient cats suffer from a laundry list of ailments, including eye degeneration and a dangerous—and potentially fatal—heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. And cats who don’t get enough omega-6 fatty acids (particularly one called arachidonic acid) in their diets might suffer from immune system problems. Further, eating too much food that is not meat can be bad for cats. Cats can’t break down dietary starches easily, as their guts are relatively short, and they don’t produce very much of a starch-dissolving enzyme called amylase. This can result in diarrhea or bloating. Vegan pet foods attempt to supplement their chow with the perfect balance of lab-synthesized taurine and omega-6s, as well as a ton of extra protein from plant sources. “It probably is possible to get those [essential nutrients] on a vegan diet if it’s really well balanced and put-together,” says Alexandra Whittaker, an animal welfare scientist at the University of Adelaide in Australia. But whether Impossible Kibble can keep cats healthy in the long run is hard to say; the additives may not be as easy to absorb as their natural, meat-occurring counterparts. The maladies caused by a lack of essential nutrients don’t show up overnight. Instead, they can take months or even years to manifest, Harvey says. And even then, they can be hard to spot; cats are famously good at hiding illness. (There’s a reason the old cliché is “sick as a dog.”) These factors make it tough to study whether and when vegan felines may start to develop nutrient deficits. Andrew Knight, an animal welfare and ethics researcher at the University of Winchester in the U.K., recently conducted a survey of more than 1,300 cat guardians in the U.K. The results showed that the 127 people who reported feeding their cats a vegan diet also reported that their pets had fewer vet visits and common disorders compared with folks who fed their cats a non-vegan diet. For Knight, the study is proof positive that cats can be perfectly healthy on a plant-based diet. “Our results reflect what real cat owners would see in real homes,” he says. But for other researchers, the paper is far from conclusive. “That was a trend,” not a statistically significant result, says Whittaker, who was not involved in the study. She points out that the survey didn’t stipulate whether the vegan cats were fed an exclusively plant-based diet; some of the purportedly vegan kitties were indoor/outdoor cats who might indulge in the occasional mouse, for example. And other pet parents might still give their cats traditional food in addition to the vegan variety. Zoe, for example, supplements her cat’s plant-based meals with some meat-based wet food. Her cat is vegan-ish. Further, since Knight’s was a self-reported survey, the results weren’t directly verified by the researchers—it’s possible owners weren’t accurately assessing their pets’ health. To really assess their physical condition, the researchers would have to look at the cats themselves, Whittaker says. With so much uncertainty and potential complications, why go through the trouble of feeding your cat a vegan diet at all? For one thing, the environmental toll of meat farming is a doozy. Although it pales in comparison to raising livestock for human consumption, commercial cat- and dog-food production emits a non-trivial amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide. One study found that food production for the U.S. pet population alone accounts for as much as 2.9 percent of agricultural CO2 emissions. Another study, of pets in China, found that their collective carbon “pawprint” was equivalent to that of up to 245 million people. It’s also worth noting that, while feeding cats plants might be “unnatural,” so is feeding them kibble made of tuna, chicken, salmon, or beef—prey that they would never hunt in the wild. And even non-vegan pet foods must add supplements to ensure that they meet vet-recommended nutrition standards. “The pet food industry as a whole is quite poorly regulated,” says Harvey. Though things have improved markedly in recent decades, the reason we know so much about feline taurine deficiency at all is because many commercial cat foods in the 1970s lacked sufficient amounts of the nutrient. (Still, going with kibble is far better than attempting to feed pets a homemade diet, especially if you’re trying to get them to go vegan, Knight cautions.) And then there’s the simple fact that we project onto our pets. We want them to be like us; if we’re eating plant-based food, it’s comforting to see them do the same. For her part, Zoe worked very closely with her vet before embarking on a vegan meal plan for her cat. “Obviously, if I felt my cat would suffer on a vegan diet, I certainly wouldn’t do it,” she says. But at the end of the day, given how little research has been conducted, most vets and animal welfare researchers wouldn’t recommend switching your cat to a fully vegan diet just yet. “There’s just not enough evidence out there to make a determination as to whether it’s safe for cats,” says Whittaker."
2023-10-29,10:30:56+00:00,,How climate conscious Americans reduce their carbon footprints,https://phys.org/news/2023-10-climate-conscious-americans-carbon-footprints.html," October 29, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: Bala Sivaraman drives an electric car around the US capital Washington, buys used clothes and furniture and cooks his vegan meals on an induction stove he bought after parting ways with his gas oven. Sim Bilal relies exclusively on public transit—no easy feat in car-centric Los Angeles—uses refurbished tech and lives in an apartment with solar panels. As world leaders prepare to meet for crunch COP28 climate talks in the United Arab Emirates next month, some environmentally-conscious Americans are demonstrating it's possible to rein in their carbon emissions, aligning their actions with their values in a country where such lifestyle choices are rare. ""When we are inundated with a lot of climate doomsday news, it can be really difficult to feel we have something to ground us,"" Sivaraman told AFP. ""What is so powerful about living a sustainable life or committing ourselves to zero waste living practices is that it gives us that sense of hope, because it reclaims our power."" Living on opposite ends of the country, both young men work as environmental activists and have carbon footprints of three to four tons per year, according to self-reported estimates generated by carbonfootprint.com. That's well below the average Americans' annual footprint of around 15 tons, which is roughly three times the global average. On a brisk autumn day, Sivaraman brings his compost to a local community garden, unlocks a sorting bin, and begins placing leftover vegan hotdogs, paper plates and other biodegradables inside. ""This was from a party at my friend's animal refuge the other day,"" the 28-year-old, who works in communications for the nonprofit Earthjustice, says, covering the pile with the dry brown waste to aid in the decomposition process. After six months, the nutrient-rich soil is used in the neighboring plots to help tomatoes, cilantro and other vegetables grow. ""Composting diverts organic waste out of landfills,"" he explains, and because it decomposes in the presence of oxygen, it produces far less climate-impacting methane. It also helps foster a sense of common purpose and community, he adds. Bilal, 21, got his first taste of direct action last year after disrupting the LA mayoral debates, making local news as he led demands for candidates to release their climate action plans. ""This is the number one problem for my generation,"" he told AFP. He now organizes for the California Green New Deal coalition and Youth Climate strike in Los Angeles. Though getting a driver's license is a rite of passage for US teens, Bilal decided when he turned 16 the climate cost was too great to bear. When he's not riding the LA Metro or taking intercity trains, he can be found on his One Wheel: a self-balancing electric skateboard he finds essential for the last mile in a city where public transport can be lacking. The clothes he's wearing during a video interview are four years old and his iPad is a five-year-old model that he recently had repaired after cracking its screen, instead of buying a new one—measures that embody his philosophy of buying less, and buying to last. ""It is hard because some things look really cool—maybe you want to jump on a trend, but for me it's not worth the cost,"" he adds. Sivaraman—who also participates in direct action with the Sunrise Movement and was arrested for the first time in September at the Federal Reserve building in New York—said his health and well-being had only improved since he made more climate-aware choices. The idea that weaning off fossil fuels would cause people to have ""miserable, sad lives"" is a ""very effective PR tactic"" pushed by the industry, he said. ""Across the board—health, emotional happiness, financially... There's so many benefits to living a zero waste, sustainable life, and I'm living proof that's the case."" "

Although the family provide ‘a good variety’ of options and ‘respect her choices’, many were shocked at her catering choices for the meet-up. ‘She said that the entire menu would be vegan to align with her beliefs and that it’s a chance for the family to try something different,’ read the post. ‘Some family members were excited, but others, including many of the older folks, were pretty upset and felt like they were being forced into her lifestyle, even if just for one meal.’ Following this announcement, the man took his sister aside and asked if she’d be open to including some non-vegan dishes, but she ‘got quite defensive, saying this was her chance to showcase veganism and that for one meal, everyone can give it a go.’ He claimed he felt ‘forcing an entire family to adopt her choices, even if just for one meal, isn’t fair,’ and clarified that the issue isn’t due to handling or preparing animal products as his sister works at a fast food restaurant and does so daily. Yet his sibling is upset with him for ‘not being supportive’, so while the reunion may be meat-free, it’s anything but drama-free. Responses from Redditors were largely mixed. On the ‘you’re in the wrong’ camp, one person commented: ‘It’s one meal! You say you respect her beliefs, but want her to go against them for you all in her own home.’ McDonald's to slash price of Big Mac, McNuggets and more to just 99p in November ‘People act like vegan meals come from Martian farms via teleportation. It’s literally just everything you eat except for the meat, dairy, and eggs,’ said another. ‘It’s like someone says the word “vegan” and people forget they have been eating vegetables and fruits for years… If anyone is upset they can do whatever vegans have done for decades and bring a little something for themselves or eat before or after.’ A third person added: ‘If a friend whose religion forbids pork invites me to their place for breakfast, the fact there’s no bacon with my pancakes isn’t them forcing their beliefs onto me. But if I asked them to provide bacon because it’s my preference, I’d for sure be disrespecting their beliefs.’ On the opposite side, someone wrote: ‘She’s not being a great host in that you want your guests to be comfortable. All the rules that would apply to her being taken care of at others houses apply to her hosting as well.’ Another said: ‘The sister’s direct response to being asked to accommodate those who didn’t want to eat only vegan food is that she wanted to showcase her vegan food and that they could eat it for one meal. ‘This is her in no uncertain terms deliberately choosing to force vegan food on others even against their will, for her own reasons.’ Others offered compromises like guests bringing their own non-vegan dishes or suggesting crowd-pleasing plant-based dishes like dips and veggie burritos, but some merely argued the family should suck it up and try to enjoy the gathering. There’s certainly stigma attached to the label, as a study found that calling plant-based food vegan made people less likely to try it. Yet despite vegan diets being good for everything from lowering cholesterol to reducing the risk of bowel cancer, it’s still divisive. Perhaps if this man’s sister hadn’t said the V-word to her family, they’d have happily enjoyed what she served up. Do you have a story to share?

2023-10-26,05:38:45+00:00,,BORUCH DAYAN HAEMMES: HAGAON HARAV BORUCH MORDECHAI EZRACHI ZT”L,https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/israel-news/2234561/boruch-dayan-haemmes-hagaon-harav-boruch-mordechai-ezrachi-ztl.html,"YWN regrets to inform you of the petirah of Rosh Yeshivas Ateres Yisrael and Zakein Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, Hagaon HaRav Boruch Mordechai Ezrachi Zt”l, at the age of 94. HaRav Ezrachi has been ill and hospitalized for the past four months and was recently on a respirator but there was an improvement in his condition in the past week. However, on Thursday morning, his condition worsened. The bitter news of his petirah at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem, especially during such a difficult time for Klal Yisrael, left the Torah world in deep aveilus. HaRav Ezrachi was a leading figure in harbatzas Torah and yiras Shamayim for decades. He was a Maggid Shiur for over 60 years in Yeshiva Knesses Chizkiyahu in Kfar Chassidim, in Chevron Yeshiva, and later served as the Rosh Yeshiva of Ateres Yisrael in Bayit Vegan in Yerushalayim [which later moved to Modiin Illit], and was a senior member of the Moetzes Gedolei Yisrael of Degel Hatorah and a member of the Va’ad HaYeshivos. He was a tremendous Gaon and wrote many Seforim on Torah, Gemara, Halacha, and Machshava, called Birkas Mordechai (ברכת מרדכי‎). He was born in Petach Tikva to his father and mother (Rav Yisroel and Hinda) and learned in Chevron Yeshiva as a bochur. His wife, Rebbetzin Shulamis Ezrachi A”H, was niftar in December of 2022 and HaRav Ezrachi, z’tl, will be buried next to her, on Har HaZeisim. She was a daughter of the famed Chevron mashgiach HaGaon HaRav Meir Chodosh Zt”l. HaRav Ezrachi, z’tl, left one son, four daughters, and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren – all following in the path of Torah and mitzvos. His only son, HaGaon HaRav Ben-Tzion Ezrachi, who serves as a Rosh Mesivta and the Nasi of Ateres Yisrael, received the bitter news of his father’s petirah while in Mexico, where he had traveled for the benefit of the yeshivah. The levaya will be delayed until his return and has been scheduled to take place at 9 a.m. on Friday morning, leaving from the home of the Rosh Yeshivah, z’tl, in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood of Yerushalayim. HaRav Ben-Tzion is scheduled to land in Israel at 7 a.m. on Friday morning. The Rosh Yeshivah’s mitah was brought from the hospital to his home in Bayit Vegan, where his talmidim lit candles and burst into bitter crying."

And it all kicked off with dessert — frozen strawberry guava with the essence of coconut and kaffir lime. “A few small bites of dessert before you start the meal aids in digestion and absorption of vitamins and nutrients,” Mars told the intimate group after a cleansing sound bath that included Chinese medicine expert Dr. Mao Shing Ni, as well as actress and realtor Leslie Bega. “A little sweetness to start out will help digest the proteins before they start to ferment and cause digestive issues. Matthew has taken the herbs and plants gathered from my urban garden and transformed them into art for the body and mind. By combining the earth, the water, the fire and the air, we can reclaim the micronutrients from the colors out of the garden.” Angel Gomez , left, and Matthew Kenney in the kitchen (Michael Bezjian/Getty Images for Lighthouse Studios) Those colors included a seafoam green heart of palm ceviche with passion fruit, avocado, yuzu and shiso, delicata squash with dry miso and nori in a white sesame sauce, as well as roasted artichoke hearts with chermoula and red kale salad with plant-based blue cheese and quince paste. Beverages included a hypnotic blueberry and elderberry kombucha with a smoky touch of mezcal. In addition to a healing meal from the Plant, Food + Wine owner, the evening featured aromatherapy, sound healing, yoga and reflexology in Mars’ backyard Ayurvedic earth bath buzzing with bees at the center of the garden. Words of wisdom were shared by Dr. Mao, on how to best manage the flow of energy for a peaceful life. The author of 18 books including Secrets of Longevity, he’s also the co-founder of Yo San University in West Los Angeles, holds two doctorates and is board-certified in anti-aging medicine. Mars is currently developing Venice Beach, 90291, a show based on her local community and efforts to turn Venice back into a garden.

2023-10-24,11:32:41+00:00,Juliet Kinsman,It's time to be more demanding about our 'Climatary requirements',https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/sustainable-travel/riders-morals-climateawareness-green-sustainability-b1114132.html,"Before I hit the road (or rails) on a work trip, I’m often asked in advance by hosts or trip planners whether I have any food-related allergies. Instead I consider the sustainability fails that bring me out in hives, and try to speak up ahead to avoid any itching. We’re not shy about demanding that chefs adapt to our dairy- or wheat-swerving requirements – so what’s wrong with sending a 'responsible rider’ ahead to ensure our itineraries adhere to our values? It’s less about being a diva, more about hoping that, by asking certain questions, it will prompt a deeper reflection and awareness. If sending over my 'climataries' encourages hotels, tour operators, event planners or colleagues to think in a more climate-conscious way, that's got to be a good thing for everyone in the long run. Let’s be as proud to declare our ‘climataries’ as our dietary requirements. The questions to ask... Can I get there by train? It boggles my mind when someone says they’re flying to Paris from London for work. The Eurostar whizzes you there faster, free of airport hassles, and you can work all the way. Heading further afield in Europe? Just build in some more time to be seated at that desk-on-the-go. An Interrail pass isn't just for students – it can also be just the ticket for great value business travel. Some hotel groups even offer a discount to train travellers, such as The Hoxton with its Good Rate. Will my transfers be electric? Your hosts or corporate travel manager might discover there's a Tesla waiting in the wings at your chosen destination. Even just enquiring might move a concierge somewhere to start offering a same-price-as-usual car service that uses vehicles powered by green energy, which they might not have considered otherwise. Is my accommodation eco-friendly? If this query inspires whoever’s handling this to do a little homework, that’s no bad thing if it results in them checking you in to a stay that is certified green. Plus it’s a little wake-up call about how every choice is a chance to pick a more positive impact-led option. If the decision-maker is led by corporate partnership deals or company loyalty points at least it pushes them to pick the chains with better measurement and accountability around their sustainability. Are businesses you are visiting locally owned? Adapt this enquiry depending on the nature of your job, what you’re going away to do or whether you’re tacking on any extra time to make the most of being away. Just be vocal about loving local experiences, where tour guides and establishments you visit are away from the mass-tourism circuit. Favour niche, ethical, responsible suppliers that leave more money in local pockets. Some demands to make... No single-use plastic anywhere, please. That might mean someone checking with the hotel that it doesn’t provide those little plastic disposable amenities and serves water in refillable glass bottles. It might also inspire a ripple effect of deeper thinking from every link in the value chain, from where you’re sleeping to wherever your meetings are taking place. It’s jarring and dispiriting when you’re away to see so much single-use plastic in circulation. Better vibes all-round from when you try to mitigate in advance than ending up with anyone complaining along the way. Climate-friendly diet, please. This can bamboozle people – but again, asking the question in itself is an act of micro-activism. A general interpretation is that it prioritises a plant-friendly menu of local, seasonal vegetables and fruit and minimal meat (in particular methane-making ruminants, favouring local cuisine with ingredients from small suppliers, with no imported ingredients. This ‘slower' way of eating with a lower ‘food print’ results in a better taste of the destination, too. Some may tell you going vegan is the quickest shorthand for being more planet-positive – but as we know, the discussion around good and bad between food and the environment is nuanced. Vegan items like oat milk need to be imported – so cow’s milk could be the better option depending on the destination. It’s about weighing up the trade-offs and thinking more laterally, and about the bigger-picture. No food waste. Boldly set out your stall for ordering à la carte, so your employer only pays for what you’re definitely going to eat. Say you like to avoid buffets or spreads of food that risk not being eaten and have to be thrown away. You might like arriving to a huge platter of cold cuts in your room – or you might feel guilty as you watch them curl up and remain untouched. If you’re not worried about sounding really particular, you could even ask whether your hosts at the chosen restaurants compost their leftovers or if the kitchens feeding you reuse any extras with circularity. Less guilt about that welcome bowl where you don’t eat every piece of fruit if you know it’ll end up being alchemised into candied sweets, say. The more questions you ask, the more people think. Say no to gifts. Presents come from a spirit of generosity, so this can be sensitive to navigate: but generic, mass-produced merchandise made in China is usually destined for landfill. Just say you wince at all the consumerism in our world and love to avoid any promotional gifts, as you don’t have any space at all in your bags. If there’s a special something sourced from a local maker, or social enterprise, is made from sustainable materials, supports positive impact socially, environmentally or economically, then of course you'll cherish their kind memento. Let’s be as proud to declare our ‘climataries’ as our dietary requirements. And popularise being particular – for the planet and local communities. Easy tip when planning your next work trip: simply cut and paste some of these statements just as a rock star might declare in advance what they would like provided in their dressing room. Or send a link to this article next time someone asks if there’s anything they should be aware of before planning your work trip. For our new campaign, project editor Juliet Kinsman told us what sustainable travel means to her ""We need travel to be actively helpful, and climate friendly — ideally regenerative to ecosystems or less-well-off economies. The way I judge and categorise trips, hotels, businesses, is by weighing up that their overall impact is positive and purposeful, not just performative, and whether their ownership is actively doing measurable good for nature or their communities."""
2023-10-23,22:45:52+00:00,GabCrabtree,"Young Black student balances business, college",https://northernstar.info/109649/news/young-black-student-balances-business-college/,"Ensure student journalism survives. Donate today. DeKALB – For a lot of students at NIU, their focus is on school and getting to the next step in life; but Jada Samuels, a junior majoring in business, is doing both at the same time. Samuels runs a small business called Jada Juice. Jada Juice sells healthy vegan smoothies that are made with hand cut fruit and no preservatives. Jada Juice had a chance to compete at a business competition called University Pitch Madness held at DePaul University in July 2023. Samuels was the first NIU student to participate in the competition in the six years it has been held. She was also the only African American student participating. University Pitch Madness is a competition for Midwest college students where different colleges send a student to pitch their business to judges. The judges decide whether they want to invest money into the student’s business to help them grow or not depending on how well the student has prepared and presented their business. “It was a great opportunity to just test my strengths and weaknesses with pitching,” Samuels said. “To my surprise, I won first place and audience favorite for a total of $7,000 to invest in my smoothie company, so that is definitely at the top of my list for one of my best accomplishments.” Samuels said she is hoping to use the money she won to invest more in the packaging of her smoothies. “The food industry is very strict when it comes to packaging and labeling of the product, and so that can get very expensive,” Samuels said. “So this competition did a great job and provided me with the funds to be able to start that process and start making prototypes so that I can pitch my products to grocery stores such as Mariano’s and Whole Foods.” Jada Juice is starting to expand from just her online shop to smoothie bars and stores. “I’ve actually established a partnership with CloudBar Chicago, it’s located inside of the John Hancock Building, downtown Chicago,” Samuels said. “It’s a bar that’s thousands of feet in the air, and it’s on the 94th floor of the John Hancock building, and I actually have my products at the bar where their visitors are able to come and grab the smoothies and enjoy the view of the magnificent downtown.” Samuels said each smoothie she releases has a reason for being created. “Each smoothie I made specifically to combat against specific health issues and target specific health benefits,” Samuels said. “And I actually also started it so that I could begin educating my community on the importance of health.” Samuels said her mother’s struggle with high blood pressure growing up was what started her interest in healthy recipes. “I started to do research on home remedies that I can use to actually try and help her out,” Samuels said. “And I came across the benefits of fruits and vegetables, such as bananas and berries that are high in potassium that helps with high blood pressure. So I decided to make it into a smoothie, and it actually dramatically helped her high blood pressure.” Latasha Harris is Samuels’ mom and a big part of the company. Harris said that Jada Juice was not originally a for-profit idea and was just something Samuels wanted to do to help her community. “We initially had a conversation about how the homeless received their nutrition during COVID because obviously they didn’t have the same access that we had,” Harris said. “And so we thought that would be a great idea to boost their immune system up and things like that.” Jada Juice has come a long way, and there are many hopes for the future, Samuels said. “My goal is to actually have the Jada Juice smoothie bar on the campus of NIU so that the NIU students, along with myself, are able to have a healthy diet on their way to class or coming from class,” Samuels said. “I think it’s important that our students have healthy options because it’s been shown that a healthier diet also helps with your academic performance.” Samuels said Jada Juice is for anyone, but she hopes young people and people in the Black community try Jada Juice because they often struggle to afford a healthy diet. “I do want to pour into the black community as much as I am able to because they are the ones I feel need to be most aware of the benefits of a healthy diet, because typically, the minority communities don’t have easy access, and can’t often afford to have a healthy diet,” Samuels said. There are multiple flavors available now to order and try including the Slim Thick which has spinach, pineapple, mango and orange in it along with acai and chia seeds. Harris said that Slim Thick is her favorite flavor. “It’s very refreshing,” Harris said. “It instantly puts a smile on your face from the first sip, and it’s literally a common reaction to a lot of people.” Samuels describes Jada Juice as a “burst of happiness in the body.” “You just feel happy, and it’s also a guilt-free way to just enjoy a snack or a healthy beverage. And a lot of people often have a stigma towards vegetable smoothies that they’re just going to be nasty,” Samuels said. “And that’s why I specifically made sure that my vegetable smoothies have a good balance of the nutrition and flavor and not one overpowering other because when individuals drink my smoothies, I want them to enjoy being healthy.” Samuels’ products are available for purchase on Jada Juice’s website. Smoothies range from $7 to $9, not including tax or shipping. Orders will be shipped to customers or to a drop-off location.

While there have been equally talented and gifted drivers, like him, few have managed to be such an influential figure as the seven-time British world champion. Aside from his dominance in F1, he has also emerged as a vocal advocate for animal rights and equal rights. But amidst all that, fans have often wondered if the F1 star is vegan or not. In the midst of Mercedes‘ domination, back in 2017, Hamilton began following a vegan diet after realizing the harmful impact of animal farming. Fascinatingly, an enlightening conversation with a friend in New York sparked this awakening. Following this, motivated by a genuine desire to disassociate from the cruelty intrinsic to the industry. Hamilton’s commitment to his values has not only defied skepticism about being an elite-level athlete on a plant-based diet. But has also fueled his unparalleled success in F1 racing. Propelled by a profound awakening to the environmental repercussions of animal agriculture, Hamilton started his vegan journey in 2017. According to Plants Based News, he has addressed the global impact of animal farming on the environment. In a conversation with BBC, he vocalized, “The human race, what we are doing to the world … the pollution coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don’t necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.” Formula 1 Qatar Airways Qatar Grand Prix 2023 Lewis Hamilton GBR, Mercedes-AMG Petronas (Credits: Imago) Through his determination, Hamilton has managed to shut down a major skepticism amongst people. Protein intake in a diet is a major aspect of an elite athlete to have a high-functioning body. However, because other food types have considerably healthier protein content in them, vegan food has been regarded as an inferior food choice. Especially for elite athletes like Lewis Hamilton.

And especially in quite a dominating fashion. Moreover, during this period, he matched Michael Schumacher, a Ferrari icon and an all-time great of F1, in world championship titles. Besides what he eats, Hamilton has used his popular social media influence to talk about animal rights. With almost 50 million followers across several platforms, Hamilton has vocally taken a stance against whale hunting in the Faroe Islands. Further, he has urged people to end the cruelty to the animals. Moreover, he has vocally disapproved of the leather industry. He has also asked his team and team principal, Toto Wolff, to transition to vegan alternatives. Formula One F1 – Japanese Grand Prix – Suzuka Circuit, Suzuka, Japan – September 24, 2023. Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton during the drivers parade before the race. REUTERS/Issei Kato Despite his advocacy efforts, in typical F1 fashion, the former McLaren driver has had some controversy. Specifically, when PETA openly criticized him regarding the sponsorship of the Iditarod race by F1’s parent company, Liberty Media. However, he stayed true to himself and his goals by affirming his dedication to the well-being of animals and a sustainable future. Making his journey of veganism a transformative shift in the realm of professional sports. This showcases how his impact extends far beyond his racing skills. Drivers like Lewis Hamilton, and even Sebastian Vettel, who are not afraid to speak for what’s right, are important to the sport.

A Las Vegas household must make at least $113,186 annually to afford a mortgage, up 15 percent from a year ago, according to a new report from Redfin, an online real estate brokerage. The median monthly mortgage payment for Las Vegas residents now sits at $2,830, and the median home sale price is $415,000, according to Redfin. “In a homebuyer’s ideal world, rising mortgage rates would push demand and home prices down enough to make up for high interest payments,” said Redfin economics research lead Chen Zhao in a release. “But that’s not what’s happening now. Although new listings are ticking up slightly, inventory is still near record lows as homeowners hang onto their low mortgage rates, and that’s propping up prices.” Las Vegas faces a number of headwinds toward a path of affordable housing and rental rates, including rising interest rates, a lack of supply of affordable housing units and a slowdown in listings. And Wall Street hedge funds have been buying up single family homes and renting them out. The average rate on the benchmark 30-year home loan rose to 7.57 percent from 7.49 percent last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.92 percent. Matt Hennessy, a Las Vegas-based mortgage adviser, said there is a workaround occurring within this tight market whereby homebuyers buy down their mortgage rates through seller concessions that reduce monthly payments but don’t lower the sale price of the home. “My advice to those that are waiting on the sidelines for either mortgage rates or home values to drop is this: Housing inventory increases during this time every year and inventory is still at historic low levels,” he said. “When interest rates do eventually drop, there will be a surge of interested homebuyers taking advantage of the same opportunity and you will experience increased competition like that of 2020 and 2021, (with) multiple offers at or above the asking price due to low levels of inventory for the foreseeable future.” According to a study from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Nevadans need to make nearly $30 an hour to afford a fair market rent (no more than 30 percent of your income going to housing) on a two-bedroom apartment that rents for $1,455. This means a Nevada household must earn at least $4,851 monthly or $58,212 annually to afford the rent. This falls slightly below the national average of $59,450 and ranks Nevada as 15th highest in the country in terms of how much a household needs to make to afford a place to live. The report also said the rising costs of living, which have gone into overdrive since the pandemic, are hitting low-income people the hardest. “Despite low unemployment levels and stabilizing rent prices, low-wage workers and other renters with limited resources continue to struggle to afford their rents. Millions of families renting their homes simply do not have adequate income to afford even modest housing.” Contact Patrick Blennerhassett at pblennerhassett@reviewjournal.com."

Bryan Danielson (left) hits Rosenberg for the All Elite Wrestling event. Bryan Danielson is the odd combination of super aggressive world champion professional wrestler and reluctant, tree-hugging reality TV star. Danielson will be a headline performer when All Elite Wrestling comes to the Fort Bend Epicenter in Rosenberg for the first time on Wednesday, October 18. The featured match is a 12-man battle royale with the survivor getting a shot at winning the Dynamite diamond ring. The matches will air live on TBS from 7-9 pm, so wear your school clothes. Tickets are available at All Elite Wrestling online. Danielson, 42, made his wrestling debut as a teenager in 1999. One year later he was on the road to a Hall of Fame career, winning titles in every major wrestling promotion around the world. He signed with AEW in 2021 and currently is a member of the Blackpool Combat Club. For non-wrestling fans, he is better known for marrying fellow reality TV star Brie Garciain 2014. They have two children: daughter Birdie Joe, aged 5, and son Buddy Dessert (now that's a name), aged 2. As for the tree hugging, Danielson has often adopted and advocated for plant-based diets — even vegan protein shakes — a rarity in his sport and for tough, red-blooded guys like him. I caught up with Danielson ahead of his event here. CultureMap: You’ve wrestled for all the biggest wrestling companies. For those unfamiliar with All Elite Wrestling, what can they expect when they come to the AEW show Wednesday night in Rosenberg? Bryan Danielson: You can expect a great entertaining show. You can expect a lot of great wrestling. We deliver some of the best wrestling in the entire world. I think that's the staple feature of AEW. We put the wrestling back in wrestling. CM: You started wrestling at age 18. Are you aware that you’ve been a professional wrestler for more than half your life? Is your whole life one big ache and pain? BD: Yes it is. Getting off the plane last night, I was super aware of how long I've wrestled. CM: I've spoken to many wrestlers over the years. And one theme runs through all of them. When you start in the business you drive all night for a $25 paycheck. You get injured a lot. You're eating bad food at 3 o'clock in the morning. Yet every wrestler always says they love this sport. What is it about wrestling that you guys can't live without it? BD: I can’t give you a scientific answer why I’m so addicted to wrestling. I think it's because of the energy and the dopamine levels that go into your brain when you’re getting ready for a wrestling match. Then there is the feedback you get when you're out there. There is the energy that you get from a live crowd. You’re center stage, everybody’s eyes are on you. What we do is very physical. Getting hit and hitting the other guy while the fans are cheering is an incredible feeling. How it feels in your body and your mind, it’s very addictive. CM: They say that a wrestler’s in-ring character is really just a magnified version of their real personality. How much of your wrestling character is the real-life you? DB: It's really hard for me to tell and it's hard for me to differentiate between who I am in the ring and out of the ring. The aggression that I show in the ring is just my nature as a human being pumped up several times. I assume it's the same thing with acting. We put our soul out there. I'm not an actor. I go out there and I'm just who I am, only many, many times bigger. CM: You're not an actor but you were featured on the reality series Total Bellas with your wife Brie Bella from 2016 to 2021. Were you comfortable on a stage that wasn’t a wrestling ring? BD: Not really. I don't like being followed around by cameras. Like I've said, I really enjoy wrestling. For example, you're on TV for say 15 to 20 minutes of wrestling. And then you are done and you're no longer being filmed. That's how wrestling works. In reality TV it’s way different. You can be filmed for nearly an entire day, for multiple days in a row. That's really hard. I will say this, the people behind reality TV are great fun, though. I developed a lot of great friendships on the show. CM: You’re known for your interest in promoting environment causes. Is that from growing up in the Pacific Northwest? BD: Where I grew up (in Aberdeen, Washington), it's kind of like a logging community. So I learned early that we are stewards of the environment. What I really developed as a child, and my parents were a big part of this, was a love of nature. And I think the love of nature is easily turned into environmentalism. CM: You’re one of the few professional wrestlers who uses his real name in the ring. Is that a good idea? BD: It is and it isn’t. It's good in the sense of marketing yourself outside of professional wrestling. I can be Bryan Danielson and go sell whatever it is that some company, say, Hanes has Danielson underwear, wants me to promote. I can do whatever comes up that I want to do. If I didn’t use my real name, I’d have to ask permission from the company I work for, and they’d probably get a piece of the pie. From a privacy perspective, using my real name may not be the smartest thing in the world. CM: While you may not be an actor, you’re still a celebrity. Can you go to parents night at school or shop at the local supermarket without be recognized by fans? BD: I’m here in Memphis today and I probably took photos with four or five different groups of people at breakfast. So there are times when it feels like I'm a celebrity. At home, I certainly do not feel like a celebrity. CM: You were a teenager when you left your home in Washington State and enrolled in a wrestling school in San Antonio. That took a lot of determination and guts. Were you scared? BD: It was great. I moved to San Antonio when I was 18 years old. It was really cool. It was a real culture shock, too. To be honest, I was scared to death my first night in San Antonio. My apartment wasn’t ready so I was sleeping in my car in a grocery store parking lot. Around 11 p.m. or so, all these cars on the street were honking their horns like crazy and people were yelling out their windows. A cop knocked on my door and told me I couldn’t sleep in my car there. I said I was sorry and I’d move. I asked him if it was normal for everybody to be going nuts at night in San Antonio. Is this what big cities are like? He said, no, the San Antonio Spurs had just won their first NBA championship. It just happened to be the first night I got into town. CM: Wrestlers like The Rock and John Cena have become big movie stars. Do you have dreams of following them to Hollywood? BD: None whatsoever. I think if you love that sort of thing, if you love acting and you want to pursue that, it’s great. But I have no interest in acting and I have very little interest in celebrity. So I'd like to my thing as a wrestler for as long as I can. When it’s done, I’m going to just disappear. CM: Several years ago, you created the “Yes Movement” and your catchphrase was shouting the word “yes” over and over. It caught on outside of wrestling and pro sports teams adopted your celebration. What was it like knowing that stadiums packed with 50,000 fans were screaming “yes?” BD: It was mind-blowing. The weirdest thing of all was when the San Francisco Giants started using the “yes” chant and they won the World Series in 2014. They invited me to be in their World Series parade. I remember being on a firetruck or some sort of bus and it was incredibly surreal. CM: One last question and it’s something I’ve always wondered about. What is the one wrestling maneuver that hurts the most? BD: There is one move that, as I get older, sucks every time I do it. It’s when I jump off the top rope and kick my opponent in his face. I end up falling directly on my back from a very high position. Every time it happens, I’m like, why did I just do that? Actually I do know why. It’s because fans love it. "
2023-10-17,09:57:47+00:00,Helen Wilson-Beevers,FaceGym active blast vegan collagen review: Can it live up to its skin-plumping promise?,https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/fashion-beauty/skincare/facegym-active-blast-vegan-collagen-review-b2401196.html,"In our 28-day supply of active blast vegan collagen, we found four glass test tubes holding the freeze-dried collagen spheres and a 15ml bottle of hydro-bound hydrating hyaluronic acid and niacinamide serum. We were instantly drawn towards the unique packaging, which looks fun and futuristic and liked that it’s all presented in a cardboard box minus any plastic wrapping. To start the treatment, we popped one of the spheres into our palm and mixed it with a couple of drops of serum as instructed. We watched as the sphere dissolved into the serum and applied the formula to our freshly cleansed face and neck. You can also scan a QR code on the box to see face sculpting techniques, if you’d like to embrace the full FaceGym experience. This handy feature offers ways to help boost natural collagen production and product absorption, as well as facial massage moves for targeting fine lines and increasing oxygenation to the skin. According to the brand, the freeze-dried biosynthetic vegan collagen is especially potent, because this form of preservation protects the quality of FaceGym’s unique formula, which has been extracted from the fermented yeast. Read more: Best collagen supplements, according to the experts While we weren’t exactly sure what to expect, our tester was immediately impressed by how rapidly the sphere and collagen duo made their skin appear intensely hydrated. That meant they saw a plumped-up, dewy effect, which helped temporarily smooth the appearance of some fine lines and boosted our tired face. The hydration also counteracted any dullness often seen with dry skin and we also noted the pairing feels like a refreshing gel when slathered onto skin which is pleasing to apply. Between the serum’s hydration-promoting hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, and the biosynthetic sphere, from our experience this duo does deliver noticeable smoothness, and a healthy-looking radiance. During the time spent trialling the collagen we were happy to see the same super hydrating finish every day, and that made our skin appear rejuvenated and less dull. It also had a pillowy softness, and this supple finish meant our make-up looked fresher throughout the entire day too. There was a continued and noticeable plumpness, which appeared after application, and this also created a distinct glow across our entire face. We noticed it the most in areas where our fine lines are more prominent, such as around our eyes. This skin effect was obvious while using the product on a regular basis, so we’d definitely return to it for another plumping fix in the future. While this is a skincare splurge, it’s an excellent treatment if you’re preparing for a special event or simply seek a deluxe treatment from home. "

In the past few decades, our approach to pet ownership has changed. Today, pets aren’t just domesticated animals – we dote on them as our “fur babies” and “best friends”. And this tendency to anthropomorphise our pets naturally means anything we want for ourselves, we want for them too – even when it comes to food. Dr David Lee, president of the AVA’s Australian Small Animal Veterinarians special interest group, says that humans are increasingly wanting to align their pets’ diets with their own values or living situations. How pet diets are changing.Credit: iStock Driven by ethical considerations or the rising cost of living, here are some of the ways pet diets are changing. As veganism – or a greater focus on plant-based eating – becomes increasingly popular among Australians, many are applying the same parameters they apply to their own diets to what their pets eat. Sydney-based Harry Bolman has been vegan for 43 years, and feeds his cat Uma a vegan diet. He says the eight-year-old Turkish Van is thriving on her diet of vegan kibble and wet food, and took to it happily after he adopted her when she was two. Having had two vegan dogs before Uma, which ate a diet very similar to his own, mainly consisting of rice and steamed vegetables, Bolman is no stranger to the world of vegan pets. Bolman says one of his biggest reasons for feeding Uma a vegan diet is ethical. “If we transition one companion animal across, we are saving – in theory – the lives of thousands of animals that have gone in the pet food industry.” A study released earlier this month estimates that the world’s dogs and cats consume 9 per cent of all land animals killed for food. The research also found that feeding pets a vegan diet could have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. However, despite the increasing number of owners feeding their pets a vegan diet, research on the effect of vegan diets on pets remains slim, and most studies rely on owner assessments of their pets’ health. The few that have measured an animal’s health directly have only used small sample sizes – although found little evidence of a vegan diet’s adverse effects. “As medical professionals, we’re always going to rely on the data. And unfortunately, right at this very moment that objective data and the studies aren’t there,” says Lee. Part of the controversy behind pets and vegan diets lies in how pet nutrition has been traditionally understood. While dogs are omnivores like humans, and can digest plant matter, cats are obligate carnivores. This means that, by definition, they need meat to obtain essential nutrients and amino acids. However, there are some vegan pet foods – including the type Uma eats – that incorporate plant-based derivatives of the essential nutrients animals need. Earlier this month, a study published in PLOS ONE looked to find out if a vegan diet could be healthy for cats. Of the 1369 cat owners surveyed, 65 per cent were themselves vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, or reducing their meat consumption. They found that there were no detrimental health effects in the cats fed a vegan diet, and even found that “cats fed vegan diets tended to be healthier than cats fed meat-based diets”. But Alexandra Whittaker, a senior lecturer in the School of Animal and Veterinary Science at the University of Adelaide, says the jury is still out. Since the study relied on owner-reported health outcomes of their pet, there may be some bias involved. “I’d be a little bit critical of that given they’ve not really studied the health of the cat. It’s coming from a survey of owners’ opinions on their cat’s health, which could be a little skewed. They’re not medically trained.” “What I take away from the research is that cats are able to survive on these diets,” says Whittaker. “Whether they do really well on the [vegan] diet, I think is still very much the debate.” Eight-year-old cat Uma eats a vegan diet. For some pet owners, the rising cost of living – rather than ethics – has prompted them to seek out alternative, more affordable diets. Melbourne’s Tennille Langley switched her three-year-old bulldog Tank to a homemade diet 18 months ago, after finding that commercial food was getting too expensive. When she raised this concern with her vet, he suggested she put Tank on a diet of meat, bones and table scraps. After doing further research, and under the guidance of her vet, Langley came across a popular diet called BARF, short for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. While there are several variations of this, she follows a ratio of 55 per cent meat, 25 per cent plant matter, 10 per cent bone, 5 per cent offal and 5 per cent liver. Langley estimates she’s saving between $20 and $30 a week with this new diet, but says it does require a small investment of her time to shop for and prepare the meals. “I buy in bulk once a month. All human grade meat and all under $10 a kilo for me.” Tank gets about 10 different proteins a month, including quail, goat, lamb, beef, turkey, rabbit and venison, as well as offal, raw bones and vegetable scraps. Still, homemade diets can be expensive, especially if you’re having to feed multiple pets. Dr Nicole Rous, owner of Mont Albert Vet in Melbourne, says owners short on cash can supplement a kibble diet with small amounts of fresh food to keep costs down. “Look at your finances and pick the kibble that has the highest percentage of animal-based protein that you can afford. [As a vet] I would be comfortable downgrading your kibble,” says Rous. “And then just feed a bit of fresh food on the side. Get a tin of sardines in spring water, crack an egg over the kibble, or put a dollop of Greek yoghurt on top,” she suggests. Rous says table scraps can also be a healthy – and cheap – addition to a pet’s daily diet, pointing to research from the University of Helsinki that surveyed dog owners on their pet’s health status. Its findings suggested that those who ate table scraps, alongside raw food and leftovers of human food, experienced fewer gastrointestinal issues later in life compared to those who ate kibble. Advice given in this article is general in nature. Pet owners should do their own research and seek professional guidance before making changes to their pet’s diet.

2023-10-15,20:35:51+00:00,Matthew Lodge,Council joins 'rural fightback' against vegan campaigners with motion to make sure meat and dairy products are ALWAYS on the menu at official events,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12633427/Council-joins-rural-fightback-against-vegan-campaigners.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490," Published: 21:05 GMT, 15 October 2023 | Updated: 21:35 GMT, 15 October 2023 A council has joined the 'rural fightback' against vegan campaigners who call for an end to meat-based meals at official town hall events. Vegan activists have been successful in getting a number of councils to get rid of meat and dairy at internal events, sparking anger among rural communities whose livelihoods depend on them. Now their councils have hit back by passing ordinance to promote their local industries and make sure people have the choice to eat meat and dairy products, the Telegraph reports. Suffolk County Council is set to join the likes of local authorities in Cornwall and North Northamptonshire by defying the trend, with councillors set to vote on a motion that would mean it 'always' has meat and dairy at its events, alongside vegan and vegetarian options. Richard Rout, the deputy leader of the Tory-led council, submitted a motion which also encourages locals to support their local farmers. It is expected to be passed in a vote on October 19. The idea has been praised by the Countryside Alliance, which said farmers and people living in their communities are keen for support. Mo Metcalf-Fisher, spokesperson for the group, told The Telegraph: 'We have seen a number of local councils turn their backs on farmers in recent years with puerile motions that ban meat and dairy consumption and effectively warn the public off eating it. 'Rural communities have had enough and are fighting back. If we were to lose livestock farming - as is undoubtedly the aim of those wanting to impose plant-based eating - our countryside would turn into a barren wasteland. 'Red meat produced in the UK is among the most sustainable in the world. We hope all political parties support this motion. The countryside is watching.' It has also received backing from Tom Hunt, the Conservative MP for Ipswich, which is in Suffolk, who said it was important support for local farmers. He said: 'Why rely on plant-based alternatives imported from across the globe, when you can eat sustainable, local produce, be it meat, dairy or vegetables? 'This is a practical way of cutting emissions, while supporting local growers and farmers. Those who would oppose this motion are very much open to the accusation of being anti-farming and freedom of choice.' Earlier this year Cornwall Council began the fightback against vegan food after it voted in favour of a 'landmark' motion to ensure meat and dairy would be served at its events. If the motion at Suffolk County Council passes would mean the local authority will 'always' has meat and dairy at its events, alongside vegan and vegetarian options Jeremy Clarkson, who hosted his Amazon Prime series Clarkson's Farm, previously lambasted Oxfordshire County Council for its plans to ban meat and dairy The motion ensured the council's commitment to local farmers by proactively sourcing local, seasonal produce - explicitly including meat and dairy - at council events, while encouraging residents to 'shop locally' and urging them to take advantage of 'home-grown, affordable, nutritious food, both plant and meat based'. The move came after several motions passed at other councils across the country, which encourage residents to buy 'plant-based' produce in a move away from meat and dairy, while also committing to only source vegan options for councillors at events. The motion submitted by Conservative councillor Nick Craker, almost unanimously, recognises the 'huge contribution made by [our] local farmers to the Cornish economy and its rural communities'. Mr Craker said: 'Livestock production, especially dairy, is the largest proportion of the production sector, but we also have a large - and growing - commercial horticulture sector as well. 'A small minority of councils around the country, like Oxfordshire, have voted to abolish meat and dairy [at council events]. I can't begin to imagine the damage that would do to Cornwall. Supporting all our farmers and growers is essential for our economy here in Cornwall.' He added: 'Let's ensure our residents know how to source local dairy, how to cook good local meat. I ask members to back Cornwall's farmers and food producers today. It's good for the economy, it's essential for the environment and it's critical to keep putting food on all of our tables – meat, dairy and plant-based.' In 2021, Oxfordshire County Council triggered outrage among farmers, including Jeremy Clarkson, when it passed a motion to ban meat and dairy at its events. At the time, the council justified the policy saying it was 'in the interest of the health of our planet and the health of our people'. Councils such as , Edinburgh City Council, Norwich City Council and Haywards Heath Town Council in Sussex, have also signed up to the 'Plant-Based Treaty', which calls for an end to the construction of any future livestock farm and pushes plant-based food in schools and hospitals. It also includes a pledge to promote vegan food over animal products. The Climate Change Committee, which advises the Government, does not support the UK going vegan, but does recommend everyone in the UK reduces their meat and dairy consumption by 20 per cent and 35 per cent by 2050. Enfield Borough Council also removed meat from the menu of its catering service in 2020, while Cambridge City Council will transition to a fully plant-based catering for council meetings by 2026 and promotes vegan food options at civic and external events.

2023-10-14,15:15:00+00:00,Tori Brazier,Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget might be the film that finally turns everyone vegan,https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/14/chicken-run-2-review-this-has-the-power-to-turn-us-all-vegan-19652256/,"It’s been 23 years since we last saw Ginger, Rocky, Babs and their plucky crew fly off into the sunset after staging a daring escape from Tweedy’s farm in Chicken Run – and Aardman Animations is back with a second helping of gentle, stop-motion animated movie delight. And this time, might the sequel see us all go vegan? In a world that has developed a reliance on social media, smartphones, online shopping and delivery, and streaming platforms in the interim, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is at once both a welcome wallop of nostalgia and an oddly curious throwback to what many remember as a simpler time. But would it hit the same if the sequel hadn’t taken six years to make with a 350-person crew and dozens of clay figurines sculpted and moved by hand, painstakingly, for thousands upon thousands of different frames? Undoubtedly, no. One of the only nods towards the last two decades is Aardman’s decision to team up with Netflix on Dawn of the Nugget, plus a hint of CGI help in the background. The other is its big bad peril for chicken-kind as we move from a 1950s pie threat to the 1960s and the arrival of fast food. Given that US-inspired convenience cuisine still has us in a chokehold today, might a certain major chain or two be keeping a beady eye on this upcoming release? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video It’s a brilliantly simple idea as an updated concept, even if it is very similar to the first film, down to the new farm setting now being upgraded to a factory – except this time, as the new movie’s tagline goes, they’re breaking in. It must be said too, that the winning personality of the film and its characters will be enough to turn many audience members’ stomachs at the thought of a nugget afterwards. And perhaps encourage a surge in veganism too – another choice far less trendy in 2000 – especially after Ginger (Thandiwe Newton) and Rocky (Zachary Levi) hatch their adorable daughter Molly (Bella Ramsey) at the beginning? Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, directed by Sam Fell and written by Karey Kirkpatrick, John O’Farrell and Rachel Tunnard, brings all the charm of the first movie as Aardman sticks to what it does best – heart, humour and a staggering attention to detail. It’s not necessarily laugh-out-loud comedy, but it brims with that distinct Aardman personality, evident in having the factory be patrolled by sinister, laser-guided floating robo-ducks or a whole scene hinge on the smallest reactions of an animated snail. There were a lot of ruffled feathers when it was announced that the original lead voice actors Mel Gibson and Julia Sawalha were being replaced with Levi and Newton – especially when Sawalha expressed her hurt at reportedly being axed for ‘sounding too old’. Fans were reminded of their disgruntlement all over again when the trailer dropped in September too, but in the context of the full film the voice differences are not that jarring. Newton and Levi also do a commendable job of matching the tone and spirit of their beloved characters the first time around. It also helps that they are not the only replacements, with Romesh Ranganathan and Daniel Mays drafted in for Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels as Nick and Fetcher respectively, the wheeler-dealer rats, and David Bradley giving it his all as Fowler, following Benjamin Whitrow’s death. Dawn of the Nugget brings back everything that worked with its rich ensemble of characters last time: Babs (Jane Horrocks) is still knitting and offering her distinct commentary, Bunty (Imelda Staunton) is still brisk and Mac (Lynn Ferguson) is still a Scottish action genius. A new Netflix film is about a woman who dared to dream. So why is it so controversial? Are we getting trolled by Trolls Band Together? The new additions of sheltered Molly and her outgoing pal Frizzle (Josie Sedgwick-Davies) also bring a zingy energy to the film as they head on an adventure to Fun-Land Farms and what Frizzle is sure is some sort of chicken paradise – and one even better than the island that the flock inhabits now. And yes, Aardman knows the audience will feel a surge of joy over Frizzle talking about a bucket of chicken in her gorgeous Liverpudlian tones. We are also treated to the return of one of cinema’s most iconic villains in Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), whose new makeover and renewed vendetta against chickens makes her even more deliciously evil. Quake in your boots as you hear those cruelly elongated Yorkshire tones announce the ‘main course’ of her devious plan. She is aided and abetted by – in her view, certainly – the inferior Dr Fry (Ted Lasso’s Nick Mohammed) and businessman Reginald Smith (Peter Serafinowicz). The only crack in Dawn of the Nugget’s otherwise eggcellent package is that perhaps its power is diminished slightly by a repeat? Yes, Aardman was right to not mess with a recipe that made the first one the most successful stop-motion animated film of all time, but we’ve admired the premise before.

She plays competitively but can really take it to heart when a decision or her play did not go the way she wanted it to. Do you have any advice on how to maintain your resilience? Anon I’ve always tried to eventually adopt a short-term memory. As athletes, you could do 100 things right in the game, but you’ll remember the one ball you gave away or the tackle you missed or the opportunity you didn’t see. You’re always going to remember the negative, but I think that’s what pushes you and that’s what gets you to the level you want to be at. It’s what happens next and how you react to it that matters more than the actual mistake. What advice would you give to younger girls who want to play football but keep coming up against boys that either won’t let them play or won’t pass to them? Esme That’s a really difficult situation. Playing in boys’ teams can be really difficult. It’s a test of your character. You have to push yourself out of comfort zones and try and view it as a challenge if it’s something that you really want to do. But if you’re in a toxic environment, not improving and it’s becoming detrimental to your game and yourself, then maybe it’s time to find another opportunity elsewhere. Fortunately there are a lot more out there now. What can be done to sort out the ludicrous fixture schedule that led to Arsenal’s post-World Cup Champions League exit? Eric We have to take full responsibility for our exit. We’re the players on the pitch and we’re the ones that weren’t up to the standard that was needed. But I think the biggest thing for me is it was a really, really difficult situation and it’s worth emphasising that it wasn’t fair. It didn’t allow us to prep, it didn’t allow us to be together as a team, we couldn’t click, we didn’t have enough training sessions under our belt and the injury risk for players coming in was massive. We had eight players in the final and third-place playoff game of the World Cup. The number of days they had off was minimal and there’s the physical impact but there’s a mental impact as well. For me, the governing bodies need to come together and work together a bit more because at the minute it feels like the communication between them all isn’t streamlined, clicking or connecting when it comes to developing a calendar and a schedule. I understand that we’re trying to play more games, but it has to be organised better. I remember you discussing your vegan lifestyle, and how it benefits your health holistically. Just wondering how it’s going, and what would be your advice to someone thinking of making that step? Kayden Cayse I love it. I’m almost six years in now. In this day and age there’s so many options. The chef at Arsenal is incredible. Beyond football I’ll definitely stick with it. I originally went with it for performance reasons and I’ve stuck with it for mainly environmental and animal welfare reasons. A lot of people think about what you can’t have rather than what you can, and I have a much more varied diet now than I did when I was non-vegan. As an Arsenal player, do you feel you are treated equally to the men? Do you get equal access to facilities, coaches, physio, and the like? Is equal access improving over time? Do you feel there is room for improvement? Paul There is definitely a one-club mentality. Each team, whether it’s youth team, women or men, is on its own schedules and there’s not a lot of crossing paths. The gym is a shared space, which is always really nice. It’s nice to bump into the guys and wish them good luck and vice versa. They’re great at coming over and saying hello. In terms of resources and backing, we’ve gone through a lot of change in recent years after a big review and the way that the club stepped up and heard us was unreal. We feel heard, are given resources and we’re put on to the pitch with great prep and everything we need. How do you find your role as the performance lifestyle lead? Do the players appreciate the advice and support you can offer? I am working towards the level three certificate in athlete personal development and lifestyle and find it really interesting. I am hoping to use it to help the pupils at the school I teach in terms of balancing their lifestyle and their sport. Have you any advice you could give me? Ros Goatly I’m on the same course. It’s a brilliant thing that the club have invested in, to have a link between players and staff from a wellbeing perspective. Sometimes, as a new player, you don’t want to bother the manager, and the leadership group have enough on their plate, Kim [Little]’s in meetings 24/7. So, to have another role to be a bit of a buffer between everyone has been really beneficial so far. It’s mad how far a check-in goes. Just asking someone if they’re OK. You never know where the conversation is going go. Let them lead the conversation. Performance ultimately doesn’t matter, it’s the human that comes first. I’m a big believer that if someone’s happy off the pitch, or has the least amount of stress in their life off of it, then that will help performance. You are the daughter of a famous sporting father [the former Scotland rugby player John Beattie, now a broadcaster]. What inspiration do you take from him? Gordon Probably the biggest thing I’ve learned from dad is how to have a good lifestyle balance. He showed me how important it is to switch off. It’s so important to work hard, and winning is important and you have a value at a club, but switching off is important too. How are you switching off? Who are you hanging out with? Are you seeing your friends? Are you getting outside? Don’t go home and sit in the flat, go and get an education. My parents are a big, big reason why I went to university and didn’t just come and play for Arsenal. He built a career for himself from scratch off the pitch and to see him be as successful off the pitch as well is what inspires me the most. It’s funny, whenever I go and do a bit of broadcasting and meet people that have worked with dad, everyone’s always so complimentary. That is something that I want. Who is the hardest to play against in training at Arsenal? Isabel Viv Miedema. She’s just the most technically gifted player I’ve ever played with. It’s the way she manipulates the ball and the way she manipulates you as a defender, you just can’t get it off her. Her famous shift is to put it through the legs of a defender into bottom corner. That’s her thing. Also, she’s not running around constantly for 90 minutes, she just reads the game so well and comes out of nowhere. She’s so game intelligent. The joke’s on us, we’re the ones running around. Technical ability? The way she finishes, if you don’t get close to her it’s nine out of 10 times a goal, and then if you get too close, she’ll do you. Having gone through cancer treatment myself I would love to know, did you find the physical or psychological impact more difficult to deal with? Mark Gordon I’d probably say the psychological. The physical is different for everyone but mine was quite short term. Of course, radiotherapy had a bit of a longer-term effect on me physically but the surgery meant that I didn’t spend that long out of football. The psychological effect is long term. Everyone always presumes or thinks the worst, and then every six months you have to go back for a checkup. That is emotionally hard, going back to the hospital and sitting in that waiting room. You think when you go through it and you’re done that that’s it, and hopefully it is, but you still need to go back for checkups. A sports injury, once it’s done, it’s done but cancer is a little bit different in that sense. Would you do Strictly Come Dancing in the future? If your TikTok is anything to go by, I think you’d smash it! I’d vote for you! Zoe Stansfield-Cox Really? Voiceovers are more my thing on TikTok! I love watching Strictly, I think it’s hilarious. I’m not sure if I’d have the guts to do it but … never say never. I also cannot dance, so it’d be pretty embarrassing for everyone."
2023-10-14,11:00:40+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha,Meera Sodha’s recipe for vegan chocolate cake with sprinkles | The new vegan,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/oct/14/vegan-chocolate-cake-with-sprinkles-recipe-meera-sodha,"Back to baking school with this perennial favourite, with banana lending chocolate cake a lovely, moist consistency Could chocolate cake be one of the world’s most welcome guests? A prolific traveller across the globe, and an integral part of office meetings, fundraisers, dinner parties, batmitzvahs and no doubt weddings, too, the chocolate cake plays an outsized role in helping people celebrate. So I thought it was about time I wrote a recipe for a crowd-friendly (read: large), vegan and joyful one. Hot water has long been an ingredient in chocolate cakes: the theory is that the chocolate tastes richer because the water blooms the cocoa, which, along with the (barely detectable) banana, makes for a lovely, moist and luscious cake. Decorate as you wish: in my book, that means the more sprinkles and baubles, the better. For the cake300ml whole oat milk1½ tbsp apple cider vinegar300g plain flour280g caster sugar80g cocoa powder1 tsp fine sea salt2½ tsp baking powder1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda200g ripe banana (ie, 1 large one), peeled150ml rapeseed oil1 tbsp vanilla pasteVegan sprinkles, to decorate For the buttercream100g 70% dark chocolate, suitable for vegans120g unsalted vegan butter, softened80g icing sugar¼ tsp fine sea salt Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Grease a 20cm x 30cm cake tin, then line it with greaseproof paper; cut a slit in each corner, so the paper fits into the tin more neatly. In a small bowl, mix the oat milk and cider vinegar, then put to one side. Put the flour, caster sugar, cocoa, salt, baking powder and bicarb in a large bowl and whisk to combine. In another large bowl, break the banana into chunks, then mash with a fork as well as you can, so it’s as smooth as possible. Add the oil, vanilla paste and oat milk/vinegar mixture, then beat with an electric mixer on a medium speed until combined. Turn up the speed to high and beat again until the banana has completely broken down and everything is well combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, then slowly stir in 275ml boiling water. On the lowest speed, carefully mix until it comes together into a wet batter. Spoon this into the lined tin, then tap it on a worktop a couple of times, to release any air bubbles. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean, then take out and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the buttercream. Break the chocolate into small pieces and put them in a single layer in a glass or microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second bursts until nearly melted (you want the last of the chocolate to melt in the residual heat, rather than risk overheating it), then put to one side. Rinse off the electric mixer. Put the butter in a large bowl and beat on a high speed for a minute or so, until fluffy. Beat in the icing sugar – it will look like rubble to begin with, but keep beating and the butter and sugar will come together into a cream. When the chocolate is just warm to the touch, stir it into the butter mix, add the salt and beat again until silky. Lift the cake from its tin, using the paper lining to help you, and transfer to a plate (or simply leave it in the tin). Once it is completely cooled, spread the buttercream evenly all over the top and finish with a good amount of sprinkles."

Freekeh with Pumpkin Pilaf plays up the grain’s smoky flavor. Freekeh is green, roasted wheat. Use whole, not cracked, grain. Serve on their own as sides or together for a fall-themed Shabbat meal with roast chicken, grilled fish or a Near Eastern Bean Stew. For a recipe, go to tinyurl.com/bean-stew. Harissa, za’atar and freekeh are available online and in specialty, Middle Eastern and kosher markets. You can also make your own harissa with this recipe. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Grease an 8-by-8-inch baking dish, souffle or casserole dish, or a small oval baker (about 10-by-5 inches) with 1 tsp. butter. Scrub or peel sweet potatoes. Slice into ½-inch rounds. Melt remaining 2 Tbs. butter in pan over low heat. Stir in honey, harissa, oregano, garlic (if using), cumin and salt. Cook, stirring until honey is dissolved. Cover bottom of baking dish with single layer of sweet potato slices. Brush with seasoned butter. Top with second layer, brush with seasoned butter. If necessary, place any remaining slices on top and brush again with butter mixture. Bake for 15 minutes. Brush top with seasoned butter. Bake another 15 minutes and brush again. Bake another 10-15 minutes until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Brush any remaining butter over top. Serve warm or room temperature with drizzle of tahini and dollops of yogurt. Sprinkle with paprika. For a vegan or parve dish: Substitute olive oil or a nondairy margarine for butter. If using margarine, omit salt. Substitute nondairy yogurt. Put freekeh in bowl.

2023-10-11,18:25:45+00:00,Booth Moore,Vegan Fashion Week Highlights Celebrity Power in Animal Rights Conversation,https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/vegan-fashion-week-celebrity-power-animal-rights-conversation-1235870897/," It’s a testament to her dedication that founder Emmanuelle Rienda has been able to keep Los Angeles‘ Vegan Fashion Week going for five years, and through a pandemic. On Monday night, she celebrated with a red carpet event and runway show at the California Market Center that highlighted Hollywood’s role in the animal rights conversation. The evening drew animal-loving guests including “Never Have I Ever” actress Richa Moorjani, “American Pie” star Tara Reid, up-and-comer Mychal-Bella Bowman, motivational speaker Jay Shetty, and Maggie Baird, the actress-activist mother of pop stars Billie Eilish and Finneas, who came dressed in a Vegan Tiger coat with a apple skin clutch by Guillaume Larquemain. “I didn’t ever want to eat animals as a child, nor did my brother, and we grew up in Colorado. Our father was a hunter but we just didn’t want to eat it,” said Baird, who founded Support and Feed, a nonprofit dedicated to a global shift to an equitable, plant-based food system. “I’m honored we’ve been able to be a part of this changing world and getting people turned onto plant-based food. In the Billie world, we’ve been able to have vegan food on her tour and get arenas to have vegan food and get people aware of the connection of what they eat to climate change. We’ve known for decades, in 1981, I saw an infographic about McDonald’s hamburgers and the Amazon rainforest, I read ‘Diet for a New America’…But the amazing thing is now it’s a little more obvious and people are really listening and asking questions.” Hollywood has been instrumental in getting the fashion industry to change some of its ways, especially to stop using fur. “It’s always a thing, if you have some power do you work with a small brand, do you work with a big brand and there’s valid points in both. You can highlight a small brand but if you can get a big brand to change their policies and ways of making things, that has an major impact. That’s been an exciting thing to see,” Baird said. “In the beginning, you’d say things and get pushback and eye rolls. Then people start to listen, and that’s been amazing to see these major designers change.” When asked if she thought Eilish, a Gucci ambassador, had an influence on the brand’s decision to drop fur, Baird said, “100 percent and there’s more to come. And Oscar de la Renta was amazing. That was a call where we said, ‘fur — that’s a deal breaker,’ and they responded.” Among the designs featured on the runway were apple skin cowboy boots by ethical and sustainable Netherlands shoe brand A Perfect Jane, Guillaume Larquemain’s Made in France, seed-shaped apple skin clutches, and sexy cutout evening suits and separates from Houston-based sustainability consultant Dominique Side’s line Nikki Green."

During my visit, I had the pleasure of indulging in the Fiesta Burger, a gourmet dish garnished with locally sourced Credo oat milk queso, colorful pico de gallo, thick guacamole and a hint of jalapeños, delivering a mild taste underlaid with an intriguing spicy note. This provided a memorable sensation that persisted long after the dinner had ended. The well-balanced mix of spices gave a thrilling kick with each mouthful of the Fiesta Burger, expertly calibrated to enhance the overall taste without overloading one’s taste buds. The ample quantities of guacamole and other delectable toppings provided a mildly messy but highly joyful dining experience, which is the hallmark of a great burger.

Next Monday is Raw’s season premiere, and it promises to be the least vegan-friendly episode in history as Bronson Reed will slap meat with fellow beefsteak GUNTHER for the Intercontinental Championship. Reed earned his title opportunity after defeating Chad Gable and Ricochet in a triple threat match on the Oct. 9 edition of WWE’s flagship show. Following his victory, Reed took to social media to let the world know what was in store for the Ring General. Gunther bout to get it bros!!! https://t.co/xCYahpG4ax Gunther bout to get it bros!!! Later on Raw Talk, Reed fired up the grill once more ahead of their cookout to send a warning to the IC Champ: “...Gunther’s been going around all of WWE throwing his weight around, figuratively and literally. But next week, I’m bringing the meat! And GUNTHER is gonna find out that when you step in the ring with “Big” Bronson Reed...size does matter.” Fan reaction to the extra large encounter was quite favorable, with one person writing, “Gunther vs Bronson Reed is the kind of ‘what on earth will this match even look like’ match that I live for as a wrestling fan. Can’t wait.” With the season premiere of Raw now less than a week away, start making some room in your bellies, Cagesiders, because WWE is fixing to serve ALL the meat. Indeed, can’t wait."

We have progressed enough as a species that we no longer need to consume animals, right? Morality aside, vegan activist groups and blogs have been very adamant that going vegan is a step in the right direction to bettering our environment and ending unnecessary pollution caused by factory farming and waste from livestock. In the face of a climate disaster understanding how large industries contribute to the impending crisis is an important facet many must consider. Demonizing and critiquing others for their choice to consume meat is hypocritical once one comes to learn that any diet under our current industrial agriculture systems will not be sustainably sourced, nor climate conscious. Simply ask yourself how your vegan and cruelty-free options made it to the market. The mass production of anything will as a result harm the environment by polluting the air and water. As the effects of climate change continue to mount, many have considered their actions concerning the climate, paving the way for plant-based diets and advocates to grow in popularity, predominantly through social media. Vegan activism on social media has been used generally to garner a positive narrative surrounding plant-based diets, though it has also been a host of hate, contradiction and demonization of those who consume meat. Kadie Diekmeyer, a Canadian animal rights and vegan activist, infamously known on TikTok as, “That Vegan Teacher,” is notorious for creating controversy online. Diekmeyer has made extreme statements in the name of veganism, targeting the LGBTQ+ community, Black people, persons with disabilities and multiple religions. Diekmeyer has gone as far as to say that the killing of animals for meat consumption is comparable to the Holocaust. Diekmeyer is not the only one who has stirred controversy for their radical opinions. Before her, there was Onision, Freelee the Banana Girl, and Morrissey. They all use their platform and notoriety to shame and bully those who do not adopt a vegan lifestyle. What all four have in common is their hypocrisy, preaching of morality and humanity when they have no qualms about resorting to racism, prejudice, body shaming, promoting hysteria, and making fun of eating disorders. Demonizing people for consuming animal products on the grounds of morality is not a productive argument because it promotes another form of hatred and intolerance towards people with opposing views. It would be much more productive to educate the public using unbiased arguments on how they can apply more sustainable and ethical practices. While contemporary vegan activism on social media is focused on the actions of individuals, it is important to broaden one’s horizon when considering how plant-based diets affect the climate. Though modern agriculture and food systems are at risk of changing climate and its effects, such systems have also been found to be one of the largest contributors to the climate crisis. Modern industrial agriculture systems heavily rely on transporting goods across long distances, particularly in regions that cannot grow certain seasonal crops. This transportation, typically by air travel, creates more greenhouse gas emissions when compared to poultry meat, in addition to approximately ½ of the transported food being discarded due to spoiling. Plant-based diet foods often require the use of synthetic fertilizers, which have been found to emit large amounts of carbon and methane into the atmosphere, making up 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Farming in any case requires large amounts of water, though regions with much drier climates, such as California, must transport this water across long distances. California’s State Water Project provides water for millions across Northern and Southern California in a 600-mile span. Though it provides an important resource to much of the state and is crucial for farming, the SWP’s supply chain emits 0.25 metric tons of greenhouse gas per acre-foot of water, according to 2020 findings.

In an exclusive interview on October 9, Prasit shared insights into this novel approach that challenges traditional views on merit, deeply rooted in Buddhist beliefs. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Acknowledging an increasing demand for individuals seeking convenience in adhering to vegetarian or vegan diets, Prasit introduced a pioneering pricing structure. Offering options ranging from a brief 3-day commitment to a more profound 10-day journey, clients could now hire someone to walk the path of ethical eating on their behalf. However, it was Prasit’s take on the spiritual aspect that captivated attention. Contrary to conventional beliefs, he expressed that the act of hiring someone to consume plant-based meals doesn’t, in itself, accumulate merit for the client. Instead, he argued that true merit is earned by the person actively embracing the dietary restrictions – the one on the front lines of ethical commitment. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Prasit passionately encouraged a broader audience to immerse themselves in a 10-day vegetarian or vegan challenge. According to him, even a short commitment holds the power to make a substantial impact, raising awareness about environmental and ethical concerns. As Pattaya gears up for the annual Vegetarian Festival from October 14 to 24, Prasit’s foundation at Naklua will host daily merit-making events. He emphasized the significance of this event in fostering a community dedicated to ethical living. Free lunches, promoting plant-based diets, will be offered throughout the festival. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Simultaneously, public health and consumer protection officials met to outline regulations for vendors participating in the Vegetarian Festival. In a bid to ensure a harmonious and environmentally conscious event, the regulations include uniform pricing, a ban on foam containers, promotion of safe and biodegradable packaging, strict hygiene standards, and designated vending zones. The festival promises not just a celebration of dietary choices but a holistic approach to community well-being and environmental stewardship.

Roscoe the Bulldog: internet sensation, model, and son of seven-time champion Hamilton. Also, a vegan, just like his dad. When Hamilton shifted to veganism, he ensured Riscoe did, too. Since then, the bulldog has been healthier than ever. Considering how Hamilton has brought Roscoe up—a mix of ever-lasting care, pampering, and tough love—don’t you think the 38-year-old would make a great father? Formula 1 is a time-consuming sport. Being a full-time driver leaves little room for personal and family time. Even so, the Mercedes driver has expressed in the past how he’d like to have a partner and kids. He’s 38 and isn’t getting any younger, after all. But recently, he completely changed his outlook. Being an F1 driver is time-consuming enough. Being a dog owner and an F1 driver? That’s double the load. Oh, and Hamilton is also an uncle—well, ‘Sir Uncle’ for his niece and nephew. Whenever he gets time off—which isn’t often because of how hectic the F1 calendar has become—he ensures he spends time at home with Roscoe and his family. After signing a two-year contract extension with Mercedes, the seven-time champion said his main priority now is F1. That would explain why he said what he said in an interview with Blick. 🎙| Lewis: “It takes 10,000 hours to be a master of something. I want to spend that 10,000 hours being the best dad, way I can” 🤰😁pic.twitter.com/WP8KgKruh4 — Hamilton Insights (@LH44_insights) October 9, 2023 In the interview, Hamilton was reminded that he’d be turning 39 in January. Asked if he’s thought about having children any time soon, he went back on his earlier motivation to start a family. He said, “Not at the moment. No. I don’t have time for that. I enjoy being an uncle!” After making a U-turn in this interview about a week ago, Hamilton may have changed his mind yet again. October 29, 2023 12:13 am EDT November 01, 2023 04:35 pm EDT November 02, 2023 06:30 pm EDT November 02, 2023 07:40 pm EDT November 02, 2023 08:16 pm EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest F1 stories via Google! Click on Follow Us and Tap the Blue Star. In an interview at the Qatar GP, Hamilton was asked about what he thinks his life would look like after F1. While he explained how he had no intention of racing after F1, he did point to becoming a master at a certain skill. He said, “It takes 10,000 hours to be a master of something else. I want to spend that 10,000 hours being the best dad, something like that.” Roscoe’s Father Lewis Hamilton Makes a Plea to His 31.7 Million Followers to “Have a Heart” for a Wholesome Cause Whether he was referring to being a father to Roscoe or starting a family, only time will tell. Until then, he may have to pick up his father-son game with Roscoe because he may just have competition. Roscoe became an internet sensation when Hamilton started an Instagram account for his two dogs—Roscoe and Coco (Coco, unfortunately, passed away a few years ago). The handle is now named @roscoelovescoco and has almost one million followers. Can you even imagine? If a pet account is so famous, you know the “parent” is doing something right. Well, not everyone thinks so. McLaren’s IndyCar driver Pato O’Ward was featured on an episode of The Red Flags Podcast. A proud owner of a German Shepherd named Rocky, O’Ward also made an Instagram account for his dog. On the podcast, he was asked who—Roscoe or Rocky—has a better Instagram game. Pato said, “Well, Roscoe has more followers, so yeah.” The hosts then asked, “Who’s the better father, who’s the better follower?” Pato didn’t miss a beat and said, “I think the content in Rocky[‘s account] is pretty good.” He basically alluded that he thinks Rocky’s content is better. While discussing this further, all of them agreed that the extra S’s that Hamilton uses for Roscoe might give Rocky the edge. Do you think Lewis Hamilton is and will be a fun father?

2023-10-10,07:00:15+00:00,Natasha Lomas,Heura adds ‘York ham style slices’ to its 100%-plant-based vegan mix,https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/heura-ham/,"Barcelona-based Heura, a disrupter in the plant-based protein space since 2017, has a product hitting shelves shortly in Spain and France that it reckons will have the most committed meat eaters sitting up in disbelief. These new 100% plant-based “Jamón York style” slices are not actual ham. They just look (and we’re told taste) an awful lot like meat. But — unlike actual ham — there’s no known carcinogen risk from consuming these vegan cold cuts. The startup also claims the nutritional profile of the product is superior to meat (with a 65% protein density) — touting no additives, beyond a little salt if you consider that an additive, which they say is a first for the category. Heura is badging the product “clean label” which they say reflects a manufacturing process that does not involve ultraprocessing, chemical additives or other techniques seen elsewhere in the vegan meats category (e.g. wet extrusion). They say they’re essentially using a blend of heating, cooling, mixing and shearing (at specific pH ranges) to transform the handful of (familiar) ingredients used in the faux ham into a mass which resembles the texture and “sensation” of meat. Taste follows on via the addition of “natural” flavors. Per Heura, the “York ham style” slices run to some 10 ingredients. They’re made from water, soy protein isolate, extra virgin olive oil, natural flavors, salt, and vegetable concentrates (radish, carrot, and paprika), lemon concentrate, iron, and vitamin B12. (The packet carries a nutritional rating of ‘B’ out of a possible A-E “Nutri-Score” range.) The startup says it’s using a novel (patent pending) “thermo-mechanical” technique to produce the fake ham, which it unveiled earlier this year at an event in London — and which it says eliminates the need for food additives, E-numbers, and “any other chemically modified ingredients in plant-based food”. Accusations that alternative proteins sum to ultraprocessed ‘frankenfoods’ has been a common attack from the meat lobby — which likes to claim their products are “natural” in comparison — a tactic which totally ignores the (known) health risks attached to consuming red meat products (like ham), not to mention the level of processing typically involved (which can include a number of additives and other unpleasant additions, like the growth hormones and antibiotics fed to animals, which then end up in the human food chain). Heura’s lead R&D scientist, Isa Fernández, describes what it’s cooked up with the patent-pending technique it’s using to produce the York-style ham as “high science”, more than high tech — so no ultraprocessing here, as she tells it. Instead she says the team are using mathematical modelling to perform microstructural design of plant proteins in order to derive textures and mouth-feel that can mimic meat, without the health and environmental downsides. “This new scientific knowledge, and this new processing — the algorithms, and these mathematical models — were a key part in order to structure all these variables. Because, at the end, what we are doing is to go super deep down in the molecular structure of the ingredients, all the possible inputs for the process, and create algorithms that create these new outcomes that allow us to get to the results we are having,” she told TechCrunch. “In terms of processes… it’s only these physical processes that we mentioned: Heating, heating and cooling, there’s nothing more. With water. That’s it,” she added. “At the end, what we do to the ingredients, as we said, is just mixing with water, heating and cooling, but in a very, very controlled manner. It’s hugely designed to the finest detail.” Naturally this 100% plant-based product is far better for the environment than meat-based products since the land use required to produce the soy beans, olives, vegetables etc used in Heura’s faux ham are orders of magnitude smaller than are needed to produce the pigs whose proteins are found in meat-based pork products. There are also no animal welfare issues when the proteins in the food are derived from vegetables. There is still a price premium, though. So while a packet of Heura’s faux ham has a similar price-tag to what you might find on a packet of traditional, pig-based ham — at least the more premium-priced cold cuts — you’re getting substantially less food for your money. In Spain, where Heura’s alt jamón york will be hitting supermarket shelves this week (located in the charcuterie section), the price per packet is €2.99. However that’s for just 78g (four slices) of product. Whereas you can buy a packet of 200g of pig-based ham in the same market for around €2. Which means there’s still a considerable affordability gap when it comes to like-for-like product volume. Vegan meat products have undoubtedly achieved great strides in quality in recent years — and Heura’s York-style ham looks to be another big one — but they’ve been unable to deliver the promise of price-parity with the meat products they’ve got so good at mimicking. These higher costs have capped consumer appetite to shell out for what are undoubtedly more environmentally-friendly alternatives — especially during the cost of living crisis with food inflation riding high and food budgets pinched. Hence we’ve seen some shrinkage affecting startups in the category over the last year or so, as sales growth has failed to pan out as hoped. A family of four isn’t going to get much lunch out of a single packet of Heura’s York-style ham. They’d need to purchase at least a couple of packets to ensure there’s enough to go around — at which point the price-tag starts to look less tasty. So while the faux ham itself appears — at least to this vegetarian’s eye — passing similar to actual animal flesh there’s still a way to go to shrink production costs so that high quality vegan cuts can sell themselves on price alone. Product diversification looks to be more of an immediate focus for Herua, though — which touts more cold cuts incoming to its product line. It says the same “thermo-mechanical” technique can be applied to produce other types of deli meats from its soy-based protein. The technique could be used to produce breaded products, vegan cheeses and pasta (presumably a high protein form of pasta, since traditional pasta is already vegan). So it’s setting its sights on spreading more of its plant-based wares across the table-top of those who can afford to tuck in. “Deli meats is a big opportunity,” says Heura CEO and co-founder, Marc Coloma. “In Europe, it’s the biggest processed meat that people consume and it’s a €78 billion category. So we have a great opportunity there. And also, we are preparing big things in order to go into cheesy opportunities.” This report was updated with a correction: The quotation in the last paragraph was initially attributed to co-founder Bernat Ananos; the line was actually spoken by Marc Coloma, CEO and co-founder, who was also on the call.

2023-10-07,10:39:31+00:00,By Jess Fleming | jfleming@pioneerpress.com | Pioneer Press,Five great veggie burgers that won’t have you missing the meat,https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/07/five-great-veggie-burgers-that-wont-have-you-missing-the-meat/,"Over the years, I’ve gotten more than a few emails from readers asking me where they can get a good veggie burger. And though I really appreciate a great one, I find that many restaurants either serve a pre-made patty or a flavorless facsimile thereof. But lately, I’ve been researching regular burgers for our annual burger guide, and where there’s a house-made veggie burger on the menu, I make a point to order it alongside the beef version. I can’t recommend all of them, but I did find five meatless burgers that I would order again. Please note that I am a meat eater and prefer real cheese if I can get it, so this is not a vegan burger list. I think this rice-and-bean-based burger is probably the one I liked the best from this list. Properly spiced (even a little spicy!), smashed like the trendy beef patties and topped with American cheese, caramelized onions, French onion dip, tomato and onion (and a fried egg if you want it), it’s filling and delicious and did not make me feel like I was missing out on something better. I also loved that I could pair this with a delicious margarita and fried Brussels sprouts from Centro, which shares space with Everywhen in St. Paul. Everywhen Burger Bar: 750 S. Cleveland Ave., St. Paul, 612-489-5558; or 2412 Nicollet Ave., Minneapolis, 612-452-9785; everywhenburgers.com The solo version of J. Selby’s infamous Dirty Double is the only pure vegan burger on this list, but it’s not the only one I tried. It is on this list because it’s the only vegan burger that did not make me, as a meat and cheese lover, grimace when I took a bite. It’s a little sorcery that allows the very meat-like patty and very cheese-like cheese to taste like the real thing, and I’m not sure I really want to peel back the curtain. Taste-wise, this is just a really simple, really good burger, topped with vegan cheese and mayo, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion and served with really good fries. If you’re vegan or vegetarian (or just really like veggie burgers) and haven’t been here, you’re really missing out. J. Selby’s: 169 N. Victoria St., St. Paul; 651-222-3263; jselbys.com This brewery, with its magical, art-stuffed patio, just keeps getting better. It recently added a full kitchen and is serving burgers and other casual fare along with its delicious wood-fired pizzas. We weren’t over the moon for the regular burger (it was a little dry), but the black bean burger is fantastic. The earthy patty has plenty of spice and lots of interesting, flavorful crispy bits and is topped with guacamole, which added some needed moisture, caramelized onion for a little sweetness and lettuce and tomato for freshness. There’s plenty of inside seating, too, if the weather isn’t cooperating. St. Paul Brewing: 688 E. Minnehaha Ave., St. Paul; 651-698-1945; stpaulbrewing.com I always forget about this spot, tucked into the sleepy St. Anthony neighborhood on the border of St. Paul and Minneapolis. It reminds me of the coffee shops I liked to frequent in my college years, but with better food. I really liked that this patty is walnut-based, and you can definitely taste the nuts. I was bummed that the restaurant was out of buns when we visited, but even on toast, this was a tasty burger, topped with cheddar, hummus, greens, onion and tomato. Especially when served on toast, the hummus and nutty patty made it a little un-burger-like, but the fact that it was undeniably delicious kept it on the list. Finnish Bistro: 2264 Como Ave., St. Paul; 651-645-9181; finnishbistro.com One of the few things on Sea Salt’s menu that isn’t seafood is its walnut-cheese burger, and it was so good that I’m including it on this list even though you’ll have to wait until next season to get it. (The Minneapolis Parks restaurant next to Minnehaha Falls closed for the season last weekend.) It’s just a really good, nutty veggie burger (the cheese is inside the patty), topped with lettuce, tomato and onion and served with a side of the restaurant’s super tasty creamy coleslaw. I’m convinced that everything tastes better when eaten overlooking the falls, but who am I to count that against them? Let’s start the countdown until they’re open again.

While on the surface, these two sports icons may seem like an unlikely duo, their friendship dates back to 2013 and they have always held a mutual respect for each other’s work. One might wonder how Ibrahimovic, the soccer legend, and Djokovic, the men’s tennis world number one, could find common ground. It is true that Ibrahimovic does not agree with the principles that Djokovic adheres to. However, this has not prevented Ibra from recognizing Djokovic’s achievements. Recently the 24x Grand Slam champion attended a UCL match between his home club, Red Star Belgrade, and Young Boys. His friend, Ibrahimovic on the other hand sat in an exclusive interview with renowned television personality Piers Morgan. During the interview, Morgan asked Ibrahimovic about his thoughts on Djokovic as an athlete. The ex-MLS star known for his straightforward nature, did not hold back. He stated, “I think he’s an amazing, amazing example for what he’s doing”. However, the $500 million rich athlete did not shy away from pointing out their differences. He acknowledged, “We have different philosophies. And he has all these things he does to perform. And it and for him doing that is doing an individual sport. I was doing a collective sport”. One notable difference that Ibrahimovic mentioned is Djokovic’s commitment to a vegan lifestyle. “He’s a vegan. He does this, things getting energy from different kinds of things. I’m not 100% in it. I’m opposite,” added the 42-year-old.

I don’t need luck to perform. I decide when to perform good, I am in control to do good or bad”. The Puskas winner then concluded: “That is what I believe in. I don’t need to knock wood three times to go out and it brings me luck”. This strong statement reveals Ibrahimovic’s independent mindset and his ability to excel on his own terms. This is a mindset fans have got to see from the Swedish striker throughout his career. It is this unwavering determination that allows him to boldly proclaim himself as the greatest soccer player of all time. “You Don’t Ask the Young Guys for Respect” – Forced to Join Al Nassr, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Chaotic Spell Detailed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic In soccer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have dominated the narrative of the GOAT debate for decades.

2023-10-06,03:32:21+00:00,Hannah Wilcox,Climate change activists push for quotas to limit how many flights people take - following calls for dogs to go vegan to reduce emissions,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12600345/Climate-change-activists-push-quotas-limit-flights-people-following-calls-dogs-vegan-reduce-emissions.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490," Published: 04:32 GMT, 6 October 2023 | Updated: 08:46 GMT, 6 October 2023 Climate change activists are calling for airlines to introduce flight quotas, with travellers to instead commute long distances using ground transport. Dr Helen Hutchinson, social scientist and spokesperson for environmental group Flight Free Australia, believes flying should be scrapped entirely until it's 'safe' or emission-free. 'It's an individual action – it's the worst thing you can do,' Dr Hutchinson told 3AW's Tom Elliott on Thursday. 'A lot of that's due to the fact we've prioritised air [travel]. A lot of other countries have actually put an equal amount of money into ground transport - such as really good buses, really good trains - and we could've done the same in Australia.' Dr Helen Hutchinson, social scientist and spokesperson for environmental group Flight Free Australia, believes flying should be scrapped entirely until it's 'safe' or emission-free 'When you look at what's happening in Australia now, most of our long-distance trains have been privatised,' she continued. Elliott then questioned the activist on time constraints, explaining he gets a 'week off at this time of year' in which he spent six days in Queensland with his family. 'Now, if we'd driven it's a two-day drive there and a two-day drive back which only leaves two days to enjoy it. It's just not possible,' he argued. 'Well, there's places in the world now where they're asking employers to give people time to get to the destination. And you can go [to Queensland] by train,' Dr Hutchinson said. The host then cuts Dr Hutchinson off, remarking that it still takes two days to get to Queensland by train to which the activist simply responds: 'Yep, I've just done it.' 'What I'm suggesting is maybe you can ask for an extra four days which you can travel there and travel back,' she added. Modern day Australia couldn't exist without flying, Elliott responded. Modern day Australia couldn't exist without flying, 3AW host Tom Elliott told a Flight Free Australia activist 'The Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane air corridor is one of the busiest in the world, and people want to be able to commute and fly between the cities,' he said. 'A lot of modern business and so forth works because of that. You're saying merely we just shouldn't do that?' Dr Hutchinson said their phone call was an example of how long-distance communication is available in other forms, with a lot of businesses turning to video calling platforms off the back of the pandemic. 'It's not difficult to change your behaviours if you just look at the other options, and what we're encouraging people to do is to just look at the other options,' she continued. 'I went to university in the UK, and every couple of years I like to go visit old friends there - am I allowed to do that or is that not allowed?' Elliott then asked. 'I'm not making a choice for you, as for the people who have joined Flight Free Australia made that choice not to fly until it's safe to do so,' the activist said. 'One of the big problems with emissions is the aviation fuel, and aviation is one of the very few industries where we don't have an alternate means of energy.' Elliott then asked whether Flight Free Australia would prefer if long-distance travel reverted back to using ships regardless of the drawn-out travel times. The activist did not respond, before quietly asking 'does it sound good to you?' 'Well, not really. I don't have the time,' he laughed. 'I don't have the time to be travelling two weeks on a ship to get there. I don't think the world is like that anymore.' 'I think what we have to look at is the alternative,' Dr Hutchinson said. 'We're actually living in a climate emergency right now, and every small amount of emissions we can possibly save we really have to do. It's not a question of what we might like to do, it's a question of what we have to do.' Commerical flights have long since been a point of contention for climate change activists, with Jean-Marc Jancovici proposing a universal quota should be imposed on air travel earlier this year. The French engineer and climate activist said people should be limited to four long haul flights in their lifetime in order to mitigate climate change. The call to restrict flying comes as environmentalists were slammed this week after suggesting dogs should go vegan. Research by the University of Winchester found cats and dogs consume about 9 per cent of all land animals killed for food – about 7 billion animals annually – as well as billions of fish and aquatic animals, The Guardian reported. If all the world's dogs went vegan it would save more greenhouse gas emissions than those produced by the UK, it would free up a larger land mass than Mexico and more freshwater than all the renewable freshwater in Denmark, and would feed about 450 million additional people, the research claimed. If all the world's cats went vegan, it would save more emissions than those produced by New Zealand, land larger than Germany, freshwater exceeding all renewable freshwater in Jordan, and would feed about 70 million additional people. The revelation was regarded as 'tragic' by editorial cartoonist Johannes Leak on Thursday evening. '[Dogs] don't get that much out of life, it's all about meat and walks you know and they want to take even the meat out of the diet,' he told Sky News host Chris Kenny. 'It's just tragic.

Whether you have passionate feelings on the topic of keto vs. vegetarianism, or you’ve simply been trying to sift through all the arguments to get at what diet is right for you, the nutrition world needs a fresh, unbiased perspective: one that focuses less on pushing one diet over them all and more on the specific person looking to take on an effective nutrition plan. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible, co-authored by Matt Gallant and Wade Lightheart, stands to do just that. Lightheart, a long-time vegetarian bodybuilder, and Gallant, a strength and conditioning coach who personally swears by keto, have come together to take the guesswork (and dogma) out of choosing the diet that aligns with your goals, psychology, and genetics. When the pair first met, Lightheart was a successful trainer and was winning National Natural Bodybuilding Championships on a plant-based diet (to the shock of a bodybuilding community that thought little of vegetarianism). Gallant, on the keto path since the age of 16, was also finding great results as a personal trainer. Jokingly describing each other as “zealots” when it came to their nutrition plans, the early years of their friendship were rooted in passionate debate. “We argued all the time about food, diets, and religion,” Gallant recalls. But instead of this story being par for the course with the rest of the diet wars, the two were actually able to grow from the other person’s perspective. “At some point,” Gallant continues, “we realized that we both were achieving good success and that both of these diets were not working for everyone.” Gallant recalls some of his clients at the time having digestive problems with keto – while Lightheart was having similar problems while adapting a meat eater’s approach to a high-performance vegetarian diet. “It took Matt and I about four years to completely resolve our arguments about digestive health. We argued results and data until we determined that these fringe areas – outside the standard deviation of success parameters – are the conflicting aspects. Almost all experts just want to avoid that.” Simply put, the reasons that diets succeed or fail comes down to nuance: there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible combines 20 years of research and experience from both Gallant and Lightheart – and teaches readers how to find the nutrition plan that actually fits them. The idea that we all have different nutritional needs, strengths, and weaknesses as human beings seems obvious when said aloud, but then why do the diet wars rage on in fitness centers, grocery aisles, and online forums? It comes down to dogma. “We’re all seeking tribes,” Gallant says, “but to seek a tribe based on the diet type you’re on doesn’t make sense. Obviously, there is a lot of money in nutrition, so it’s in the best interest of many diet gurus to create a tribe of zealots that will tell the world that their thing is the best thing.” For those seeking a nutrition plan that actually yields long-term results, it’s best to trade this tribal thinking for something more individualistic to you. As an antidote to picking a side in the diet wars, Lightheart and Gallant suggest honing in on your specific goals, psychology, and genetics. Everyone is looking for a different impact from their diet. Some seek to increase their lifespan, while others strive to compete athletically at the highest level. Some of us are simply wanting to feel and look good in our bodies. For performance or aesthetics, different goals are going to warrant different nutritional plans. Then, we have psychology to look at. The right diet for you is going to be structured in a way that actually appeals to you. The insight of The Ultimate Nutrition Bible is designed to help you for life, so you need to understand your personality, habits, and lifestyle in order to find a nutrition plan that you can see yourself following to your old age. This ensures that you’re sailing with the wind, not against it. Finally, genetics plays a large role – which is where Lightheart and Gallant’s research has taken them deep into the world of Nutrigenetics. Along with help from friends and colleagues who are experts in this area, the authors explore this emerging science – believed to be one of the biggest game changers in the world of nutrition. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible In a nutshell, we all have mutations or genetic variants. Some of these are positive and some are negative. By coming to an awareness of our genetic dispositions, we can lean into our strengths and incorporate nutrition in a way that counters our weaknesses. “Eventually, every diet is going to get exposed for its liabilities relative to your genetics,” Lightheart explains, “but it might be the best one that you can do. From there, you can calibrate and tweak in order to limit those liabilities.” This recognition of liabilities highlights the damaging impact of the diet wars. There is no silver bullet for nutrition – and those who say that become blind to the tradeoffs that exist in every diet. By taking an unbiased approach – one can actually do something about the liabilities in their diet as it pertains to their genetics. Getting to that unbiased, universal perspective was Wade Lightheart and Matt Gallant’s goal from the start. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible won’t just end the diet wars – it will disrupt the nutrition industry for years to come.

Korean food has only been growing in-demand in Britain, with restaurants popping up across London and videos of Korean Corn Dogs garnering 83.9 million views on TikTok alone. So, it only made sense for the restaurant chain to give the British public what they have been craving. The pan-Asian chain's menu has had a major shake up, introducing hot pots, tteokbokki and many more delicious dishes. Wagamama launched a new menu on October 4, gracing customers with a range of new Korean-inspired dishes On October 4 the restaurant launched its Korean-infused menu with the hopes of pushing the envelope further with their innovative dishes. Wagamama also announced their first TV advertisement at the same time as the daring new menu, which is their first since 2021. The pan-Asian chain hopes the new menu will leave customers satisfied and rejuvenated after every dive into their warm bowls. Among the new cutting-edge items up for grabs is the vegan k dog - the restaurant's take on a popular Korean street food classic. The corn dog is encased in a crispy noodle crumb coating, and dished up with a fiery sriracha sauce, as well as a zesty turmeric vegan mayo. Among items gracing the restaurant's menu for the first time are nourishing hot pots, drowned in a hearty Korean-inspired broth. Not only does the warm bowl come with ttoekbokki and vegetables, but tofu, chicken or premium cut steak can be added depending on your taste buds. You can even opt for a popular spicy rice cake alongside it, if it takes your fancy. Another new addition to the list is their perfectly-balanced gochujang rice bowls, that similarly to the hot pot come with steak, tofu or chicken. The chain have introduced perfectly-balanced gochujang rice bowls (pictured) that can be dished up with steak, tofu or chicken Wagamama's have also included their own take on the famous Korean corn dog, in the form of the vegan k-dog (pictured left). The restaurant are also plating up heartwarming hot pots (pictured right), coupled with steaming Korean-inspired broth The bowls bursting with the spicy yet sweet gochujang flavours are plated up with crunchy vegetables, snow onions and pickled onions. But it is not just mains that will see as a change, as Wagamama fans will spot an array of new sides on menu's across the nation. Hungry fans will be pleased to see crispy rotis served with raisukatsu sauce, as well as king oyster mushroom skewers on the menu. But the pan-Asian restaurant has not forgotten about those with a sweet tooth either, offering customers crispy chouxnuts pumped with kuromitsu black honey or sweet matcha for dessert. Global executive chef, Steve Mangleshot said: 'We designed the new menu to nourish and rejuvenate our guests and to tap into the cultural and social trends that are exciting people in 2023. 'For this reason, we have been inspired by mouthwatering Korean flavours and street foods. 'Our test kitchen is constantly working to create innovative, sustainable and groundbreaking dishes and our chefs are excited to showcase their skills and serve up the new dishes.' The new menu announcement comes after Wagamama launched the UK's first vegan fish and chips. The chain put their own Japanese twist on a British classic by selling Tempura F-ish + Bang Bang Yaki-imo. The flavour-packed dish saw classic Beer battered fish swapped out for a lightly tempura coated 'f-ish', made from a concoction of pea protein, rice and soy in an attempt to recreate its flaky texture. The Asian-inspired restaurant also took a swing at recreating their own version of the classic takeaway chip, by combining red onion and sweet potato chunks. The imitation of the British takeaway staple did not stop there, as the chain also re-imagined the trimmings, smashing edamame beans as a unique take on mushy peas.

2023-10-05,08:05:29+00:00,Victoria Allen,"Men won't go vegan because they don't think it's MANLY, scientists say",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12593945/Men-wont-vegan-dont-think-MANLY-scientists-say.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490," Published: 05:00 GMT, 5 October 2023 | Updated: 09:05 GMT, 5 October 2023 Men are less likely to be vegans than women because the diet is not seen as masculine, a study suggests. There is evidence that men are far less willing than women to give up steaks and barbecues for a trendy vegan diet. To understand why, researchers asked 539 people to rate four vegan meals on a scale of how suitable they were for men or for women. The vegan burger, carbonara, goulash and salad were described, on average, as being more appropriate for women to eat than men. But the study suggests a vegan diet could appear less emasculating for men if it used more red-blooded language. Men are less likely to be vegans than women because the diet is not seen as masculine, a study suggests (stock image) Half the people in the study were given masculine descriptions of the food, like a 'beast burger' rather than a 'wow-factor burger' or a hearty goulash instead of a gourmet one. The man-friendly descriptions of the food included the words smoky, greasy and juicy, with the burger and carbonara described as coming in a 'massive portion' for 'even the biggest appetite'. People given manly descriptions of the vegan meals rated them as less suitable for women than men given neutral descriptions like 'creamy' and 'delicious'. This suggests more masculine marketing of vegan foods could make them seem less girly. But even though people saw vegan foods as less feminine when they had masculine names and descriptions, they still rated the meals as slightly more suitable for women than men. Unfortunately they were also no more likely to say they would like to eat the vegan meal, would be willing to try it, or thought it would taste good. Alma Scholz, who led the study from the University of Würzburg but is now based at Stockholm University, said: 'Men might be less inclined to consume vegan food due to the need to appear masculine. 'Perhaps if we used even more masculine language to describe this food, we could make men more willing to eat it.' Figures show that just 3.82 per cent of men are vegan, while almost one in 10 (9.4 per cent) women now follow the diet The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Communication, asked people to rate the suitability of vegan food for men of women from one to seven. A score of four meant it was not particularly suitable for either sex, with a higher score meaning it was more suitable for men and a score below four meaning it was more suitable for women. When a burger was described to half the volunteers using neutral words, the average rating was 3.68. But the rating rose to 3.98 from people, to whom it was described using more masculine words - meaning it was almost seen as a meal equally suitable for both men and women. Men appear very sensitive to whether food might make them look like less of a man, based on the study findings. Women's ratings of whether vegan food is more suitable for males or females did not significantly change when masculine descriptions were used - but men's did. The study authors note that meat is culturally associated with strength and masculinity, which might make a vegan diet a hard-sell. According to scientists, switching to plant-based products that mimic real meat can help the planet. Livestock farming at the current rate hurt the environment in a number of different ways. Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming. Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change. Juicy Marbles is just one firm creating plant-based vegan products, which are increasingly taking space on the supermarket shelves Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast. As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. Scientists have recently suggested that bringing plant-based meat to public institutions such as schools and prisons can help trigger a wider transition amongst the general public. 'Favouring alternative proteins in public procurement policies globally could help to bring forward tipping points in their adoption,' they say in a report.

While this can be overwhelming at first, listening to the body should be the first priority. Even seven-time Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is known as the beacon of fitness and bodybuilding, had to give up in front of time. Despite being 76, Schwarzenegger maintains an active lifestyle and trains daily. However, with time, he had to make a crucial change in his diet. A bodybuilder’s diet typically consists of a lot of meat and eggs. However, this can lead to high cholesterol and blood pressure-related problems. In a recent podcast, The Rich Roll Podcast, Schwarzenegger revealed that he has cut down his meat consumption by up to 70 percent. However, there is still a special occasion on which he does not hesitate to consume some steak. To ensure proper recovery and muscle hypertrophy, athletes and bodybuilders often rely on meat and eggs as the primary source of protein. However, they are also responsible for increasing the chances of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. While Schwarzenegger has already faced his share of heart troubles, doctors suggested he cut down on his meat consumption to ensure a healthy lifestyle. Arnold Schwarzenegger once wrote in his newsletter Arnold’s Pump Club, “I’m not fully vegan. I just eat about 80 percent less meat than I used to. For protein, my staples are eggs, salmon, and chicken”. His diet consists more of Vegan food now, while he also consumes a lot more veggies than before. However, ‘The Austrian Oak’ admits that on some occasions, he does consume a few pieces of steak. He admitted, “My diet is pretty much… I would say around 70 percent, I cut down my meat intake. And the other 30 percent is on it because of, every so often, I, once a month maybe, I make a steak at home when we watch the UFC fight. It somehow fits together, with all the mid-up to the screen.” But what is the reason behind this? Let’s take a look.

Click on Follow Us and Tap the Blue Star. Schwarzenegger confessed that it was the need of his aging body that reduced his consumption of meat. He revealed, “I’m at an age where I should just cut back because my cholesterol level should come down a little bit, and blood pressure and all of that.” Adding to this, he also stated that multiple UFC fighters are vegetable-based. Talking further, Arnold disclosed that it was Jim (James Cameron) who motivated him to reduce his meat consumption. ‘Arnie’ stated that Jim made him realize that 25–28 percent of pollution comes from livestock. All these factors combined finally led Schwarzenegger to decide to switch to a vegetable-based diet. What are your views on this? Let us know in the comments. Enjoyed Your Read?

Given a substantial rise in plant-based diets, few metropolitan areas today lack restaurants boasting vegetarian or vegan options. However, despite an apparent increase in the number of people identifying as vegetarian, a recent Northwestern Medicine study found that an individual’s genetic makeup has a major impact on whether they have the ability to maintain a vegetarian diet. The study, led by Feinberg Prof. Nabeel Yaseen, is the fully peer-reviewed, indexed study to explore the link between vegetarianism and genetics. About 48%-64% of those who claim to maintain a vegetarian diet do, in fact, report eating some meat, according to Yaseen’s study, which was published Oct. 4 in science journal PLOS ONE. Yaseen said he believes this statistic reflects the fact that biological qualities can prevent some from holding to vegetarianism. “Are all humans capable of subsisting long term on a strict vegetarian diet?” Yaseen said in a Wednesday news release. “This is a question that has not been seriously studied.” Yaseen investigated this question in his recent study, which identified three genes that have a significant association with vegetarianism, as well as 31 others that possibly are associated. Some of the genes, including two of the genes with the highest association, are involved in fat metabolism and brain function. There are more people who wish to become vegetarian than actually are, and a genetic factor is to blame, Yaseen said in the release. Yaseen’s study could pave the way for future investigations into how genetics influence an individual’s ability to maintain vegetarianism. “We hope that future studies will lead to a better understanding of the physiologic differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians, thus enabling us to provide personalized dietary recommendations and to produce better meat substitutes,” Yaseen said."

Extending strictly vegan diets to all humans could also create calorie savings that would feed everyone on Earth. This is because 6kg of plant protein are required to produce 1kg of high-quality animal protein so cutting out livestock would mean there are more calories available for people – and pets. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have shown dogs and cats can lead healthy lives on nutritionally sound plant-based diets provided they are made to contain essential nutrients normally found in meat. To safeguard health it’s important that people feed only vegan pet food labelled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards Researchers have now begun to quantify the environmental impact of pet diets and how that could change if they went vegan. Professor Andrew Knight of Griffith University, Australia, estimates this would stop the slaughter of around seven billion livestock animals and billions more aquatic creatures. It would also free up vast tracts of land that could be rewilded allowing nature to recover and reduce pollution from animal faeces that often spills into rivers and lakes, further damaging ecosystems. A 2018 estimate put the global dog population at 471 million with the collective weight of all canines equal to that of all the remaining wild land mammals. Vegan pet diets are usually formed from plants but they could in future also be made using yeast, fungi or seaweed, as some companies are using to develop meat alternatives for humans. Prof Knight said: “This study shows environmental benefits when vegan diets are used to feed not just people, but dogs and cats as well. “However, to safeguard health it’s important that people feed only vegan pet food labelled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards.” He also stressed that the pet population and animal energy requirement data he used might underestimate the true environmental benefits of vegan diets and that he had to make some assumptions, so more research is required to make his findings more reliable. For example, Prof Knight referenced US data when working out global dietary ingredients instead of working out all the various national differences. He also estimated environmental impacts using data from 2009-2011 which, if more recent, would give more accurate results.

2023-10-04,19:00:00+00:00,,Adoption of vegan dog and cat diets could have environmental benefits,http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/799825/?sc=rsla,"Request an expert contact, get responses directly to your inbox The new analysis estimates a variety of potential benefits for environmental sustainability—for instance, reduced freshwater consumption and greenhouse gas emissions—that could result from switching all pet dogs and cats in the US or around the world to nutritionally sound, vegan diets. Newswise — A new analysis estimates a variety of potential benefits for environmental sustainability—for instance, reduced freshwater consumption and greenhouse gas emissions—that could result from switching all pet dogs and cats in the US or around the world to nutritionally sound, vegan diets. Andrew Knight of Griffith University, Australia, presents these calculations in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on October 4, 2023. The livestock industry has environmental impacts, such as land and freshwater consumption and emission of pollutants. However, while many prior studies have focused on livestock impacts in relation to human diets, few have considered the relative role of cat and dog diets. Recent research suggests that nutritionally sound vegan cat and dog diets—lacking meat, eggs, and dairy—are safe and may have comparable healthfulness to meat-based diets, raising questions about their environmental benefits. To better understand these potential benefits, Knight calculated a series of estimates of the potential impacts of a hypothetical scenario in which all cats and dogs in the US or around the world were switched to nutritious vegan diets. He used pet population data from 2020 for the US and 2018 data for the worldwide estimates. Other inputs came from a variety of prior studies and governmental databases. The estimates suggest that the amount of livestock consumed by dogs and cats in the US may be about one fifth of that consumed by humans, and about one tenth globally. If all US dogs and cats switched to vegan diets, the model estimates, nearly 2 billion land-based livestock animals might be spared from slaughter yearly, and nearly 7 billion if all cats and dogs around the world switched. Billions of aquatic animals would also be spared. The estimates also suggest significant potential reductions in land and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, use of biocides, and emissions of other pollutants. For instance, switching all dogs worldwide to vegan diets could free up an area of land larger than Saudi Arabia, and for cats, larger than Germany; for comparison, if all humans became vegan, an amount of land larger than Russia and India combined might be spared. Switching all dogs’ diets could result in an estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions greater than the amount of all emissions from the UK, and for cats, Israel. The author notes that the pet population and animal energy requirement data he used might underestimate true numbers, so the true environmental benefits of vegan diets might be greater than estimated. However, he also notes that the calculations required making some assumptions, and that more research is needed to bolster confidence in the estimates. For instance, the analysis applied US data on various diet ingredients to the global calculations, instead of accounting for national differences in ingredients. It also used data from 2009 through 2011 to estimate environmental impacts; more recent data could result in better estimates. In addition, future research could incorporate data on the actual energy density of different animal-sourced ingredients, instead of averaging across ingredients as was done for this study. The author adds: “This study shows environmental benefits when vegan diets are used to feed not just people, but dogs and cats as well. However, to safeguard health, it’s important that people feed only vegan pet food labeled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards.” Newswise gives journalists access to the latest news and provides a platform for universities, institutions, and journalists to spread breaking news to their audience.

2023-10-04,18:45:41+00:00,News Department,Satirical “Dog Meat” Brand Sparks Controversy Among Cornellians at Monday Event,https://cornellsun.com/2023/10/04/satirical-dog-meat-brand-sparks-controversy-among-cornellians-at-monday-event/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=satirical-dog-meat-brand-sparks-controversy-among-cornellians-at-monday-event,"At a pop-up event on Ho Plaza on Oct. 2, satirical brand Elwood's Organic Dog Meat stressed their believed hypocrisy of meat-eating to students passing by. Elwood’s Organic Dog Meat, a satirical brand created by vegan Molly Elwood to spread awareness about veganism, arrived on campus on Monday Oct. 2 — where they stressed their believed hypocrisy of meat-eating and virtues of veganism to students passing by the entrance of Willard Straight Hall. Elwood’s does not sell dog meat nor other products of any kind. The satirical brand made it a point to challenge many students’ views on veganism and the consumption of animals by using dog meat, a sensitive topic, as a vocal point for discussion on these topics. Monday’s event was sponsored by Allied Scholars for Animal Protection, an organization that aims to produce student activists for animal protection. “I like to take the joke as far as I possibly can,” said Natalie Fulton — a YouTuber and animal rights activist who participated in the event — in an interview with The Sun. “Because one thing we’ve realized is that people don’t change unless they’re a little uncomfortable.” The Frequently Asked Questions page on Elwood’s website states its concept is not meant to evoke or be connected with a specific country — despite the consumption of dog meat being a documented pejorative stereotype for East and Southeast Asians, particularly for Chinese and Koreans. The brand claims that the goal is to correct what they believe to be hypocritical actions by those who justify eating animals but still believe in animal rights. “The only reason we are doing dog [meat] is because most people on average care about dogs. I have a dog, [and] I would never eat a dog even if it’s humanely raised and humanely killed and all that,” said Faraz Harsini, founder and CEO of ASAP, in an interview with The Sun. “So the whole point is to get people’s attention and bring attention to eating other animals.” Fulton said the choice of dog meat was to highlight the difference in perception between animals such as dogs and cats — which are primarily kept as companions — and other domesticated animals, typically kept as tools. “Society’s taught us that certain animals deserve respect and reverence such as dogs and cats but other animals are tools for us to use for resources and don’t even count,” Fulton said. “People are totally [in favor of] animal rights until they realize that they would have to change something about their lifestyle.” The comparison between dogs and other animals is a goal Elwood’s organic dog meat seeks to emphasize. They believe all animals have a right to life without having to suffer or be eaten. “I think a lot of the reason [for] using dogs … is [to grab] people’s attention,” said Jessica Cohen ’25, the president of Cornell’s chapter of ASAP. “By showing that a dog is not really any different than a cow, and a pig and other animals we eat, it’s helping people realize how their food choices impact all these animals who go through pain and suffering every day.” Cohen and Cornell’s chapter of ASAP aim to make vegan food options more accessible and affordable on campus. “We are working hard on some initiatives in the dining hall,” Cohen said. “We are trying to get more plant-based options.” Elwood’s presence caused mixed reactions from students, however, with many questioning the organizers’ motives and the views they represented prior to the event. “I had heard of the event beforehand and then I saw some posts on social media about this event being racist,” Ryan Noonan ’25 said. “Why are people saying it’s racist? I wanted to come and see what I thought about it.” Although Elwood’s strategy drew many students to the event, some students found it to be ineffective in convincing students of the brand’s mission. “I personally think it’s failed,” Noonan said. “If you look at the backlash, it doesn’t really matter how good your arguments are if people aren’t receptive to them.” However, not all reactions to the event were negative. “I just decided to stop by because it seemed really interesting,” said Owen Luo ’27. “I thought [the event] really stood out to me and kind of changed my perspective, because I would never eat a dog. But then on the other hand, I am going to eat all these other animals, and it’s like cognitive dissonance.” Anthony Nagle ’27 is a Sun contributor. He can be reached at [email protected]."

The alleged cryptocurrency fraudster, 31, was in Manhattan court Tuesday to face a jury for the first time, where he stands accused of embezzling funds from FTX customers and funneling them to his hedge fund Alameda Research. He was seen in court sketches beginning his trial without his famously long locks, and he wore a slim-fitting suit with a yellow tie as jury selection began. Bankman-Fried's preparations for trial were upended, his lawyers claim, after his record $250 million bail bond was revoked on August 11, as they alleged he has been forced to subsist only on bread, water and peanut butter. In court sketches, the results of his strict vegan diet - which his lawyers claimed led him not to receive enough food behind bars - could be seen Bankman-Fried, 31, stands accused of embezzling funds from FTX customers and funneling them to his hedge fund Alameda Research After the former billionaire was sent behind bars to await trial on August 11 (pictured in court that day), his lawyers claimed he was fed a 'flesh diet' and forced to subsist on bread, water and peanut butter :: Do you have a negative opinion about cryptocurrency? :: If a company involved in the cryptocurrency industry or the financial industry fails, do you feel that only the owners of the company must be to blame? :: Do you have any negative opinion about amassing wealth to support causes to improve the world or help others? :: The defendant in this case has ADHD, which might affect things like his physical behavior, body language, or eye contact. Please raise your hand if you have never had any personal or professional experience with ADHD. Do you have any opinion about the fact that the defendant has ADHD? Ahead of his trial, which could see him sentenced to up to 115 years in prison, Bankman-Fried trimmed his unkempt hairstyle which became a key part of his image before FTX collapsed. It is unclear where Bankman-Fried got the haircut but inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is being held, are given access to a barber. At the same time they complained about his prison diet, Bankman-Fried's legal team also alleged that his trial preparations were hampered by a lack of access to computers or his medication. He was previously granted access to Adderall, after his lawyers told the court that he would take 10mg tablets three to four times a day for his ADHD. By the end of the court's proceedings Tuesday, jury selection was nearly finished, paving the way for opening statements to begin Wednesday morning once the final 18 members of the panel were chosen. Both the prosecution and defense said they would need around half an hour each to open the case. During jury selection one prospective juror said they did not think they could serve because their twin brother lost so much to cryptocurrency it ‘almost ruined him’. One woman said she didn’t understand crypto currency, sparking Judge Lewis Kaplan to tell her she wasn’t alone. Another woman said she had concerns about her impartiality because a friend of hers hanged himself after getting caught up in a Ponzi scheme. Judge Kaplan told the prospective jurors to arrive half an hour early on Wednesday due to the ‘festivities’ taking place at the New York Supreme Court next door, where Donald Trump’s fraud trial is taking place. The 31-year-old saw his record $250 million bail bond revoked in August after repeatedly angering prosecutors and breaching his conditions, including using a VPN to stream the Super Bowl while banned from the internet The former financial wunderkind has seen a catastrophic fall from grace after launching his cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019, which grew into a platform worth tens of billions of dollars within years. He lived lavishly and made a series of extravagant purchases - including lucrative political donations - while recruiting A-list celebrities such as Tom Brady and Larry David to promote his status. But when the company suffered a disastrous collapse in November 2022, his customers were left without around $10 billion, prosecutors claim. His alleged $8 billion scheme has been branded 'one of the biggest financial frauds in American history', and the trial is anticipated by some to produce fireworks as Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend and former top lieutenant, Caroline Ellison, 29, is expected to be the prosecution's star witness. Ellison, who ran Alameda Research, may see her credibility challenged by Bankman-Fried's defense as she could take the stand alongside former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. Wang was FTX's chief technology officer, and once ranked as the 227th richest person in America before the platform collapsed. He pleaded guilty in December to wire fraud and three conspiracy counts of wire and securities fraud. Singh was the director of engineering at FTX, and pleaded guilty in February to charges of wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance misdeeds Bankman-Fried's attorneys have signaled credibility may be a key part of their case, potentially arguing those testifying against him are motivated to implicate their client to get a lower sentence for themselves, a common strategy in white collar fraud cases. A bombshell trial is expected to feature his ex-girlfriend and former top lieutenant, Caroline Ellison, 29, as the prosecution's star witness Also potentially testifying against Bankman-Fried is former FTX executives Gary Wang (left) and Nishad Singh (right). Wang was FTX's chief technology officer, and once ranked as the 227th richest person in America before the platform collapsed. Singh was the director of engineering at FTX, and pleaded guilty in February to charges of wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance misdeeds Bankman-Fried, pictured sleeping on a beanbag, had an almost god-like reputation within the crypto industry, but prosecutors allege it was built on lies The case has been likened to the trial of Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, who was jailed for 11 years for defrauding investors in her medical company out of $945 million The case has been likened to the trial of Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, who was jailed for 11 years for defrauding investors in her medical company out of $945 million. Potential jurors in Bankman-Fried's case are expected to be asked whether they have a negative view of crytpocurrency, and whether they have any experience with ADHD, a condition Bankman-Fried has. Like Holmes' case, it is likely to include reams of complicated financial evidence. It will also delve into the complex technology behind cryptocurrency and trading, in a similar vein to the inclusion of complicated scientific evidence in Holmes' trial. Bankman-Fried's is the highest profile case U.S. prosecutors have so far brought against a former cryptocurrency executive. His indictment last December marked a spectacular fall from grace for Bankman-Fried, who had garnered a reputation as a legitimate operator in an industry whose image was pockmarked by scams and purported get-rich-quick schemes. Prosecutors say Bankman-Fried built that reputation on lies and bolstered it with endorsements from celebrities and star athletes. Bankman-Fried has been detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since Aug. 11, after the judge found he had likely engaged in witness tampering - including by sharing Ellison's personal writings with a reporter. He will be brought to court early on most days to allow him to prepare with his lawyers. The comments below have not been moderated.

2023-10-03,08:26:27+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amelia-tait,‘I can’t kill a wolf but will happily watch a Sim drown’: murder and morality in video games,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/oct/03/murder-morality-video-games-harvest-little-sister-kill-zelda-ethics,"From being unable to harvest ‘little sister’ characters but happy to kill others freely, to playing the Legend of Zelda as a vegan – gaming ethics are complex and highly personal I can kill foxes but I can’t kill wolves. Not in real life, obviously – in real life I send emails eight hours a day – but in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, where every animal is an arrow away from becoming a fortifying meal. Shoot a wolf and you’ll be rewarded with a thick red slab of raw prime meat, but I can’t do it, I just can’t do it, even though they often attack me in packs. They look too much like dogs. I can kill a fox – even though they never attack me, and they often let out sad little yelps – but many other gamers can’t. One post in the Tears of the Kingdom subreddit is entitled, “I can’t shoot the foxes” and has almost 500 upvotes. “They’re so sweet and nice I can’t bring myself to hurt them,” the original poster wrote. None of this, naturally, makes a lick of sense. Foxes, wolves, whatever – every animal in Tears of the Kingdom is made entirely of code. Morally and materially, there is no difference between shooting a wolf and clubbing an enemy to death with a boulder attached to a stick (in the game, I repeat, in the game). Yet somehow, many of us find one of these actions emotionally easier than the other. Why exactly is this, and what other ethical limitations do gamers set for themselves? Twenty years ago, a software engineer who we shall call Tom (he asked not to be identified) decided to return the Nintendo strategy game Pikmin to where he bought it. The game’s eponymous creatures are tiny half-plant, half-animals who make suitably adorable squeaks; as the protagonist, you round them up and use them in combat. Though it is entirely possible to complete the game without sacrificing a single Pikmin, the mites are clearly intended to be expendable – something that troubled Tom. “It was very frustrating and saddening,” he says. Tom, who is now 42 years old and lives in Alabama, felt sorrow and disgust when he reached the game’s first boss and realised he would have to sacrifice his newfound friends. So he conscientiously objected and returned the game. Despite this, he can play games where he needs to kill people in self-defence, or where the actions of the protagonist are explicitly presented as immoral. “Pikmin definitely crossed a line for me that other games didn’t,” he says “This was not just killing in defence … It was throwing away the lives of those I’d recruited for my own purpose.” Is all of this as simple as not wanting to “kill” things that are cute or harmless? Some people don’t shoot the horses in Red Dead Redemption and animal rights organisation Peta once condemned catching bugs in Animal Crossing. Yet our gaming ethics are often highly personal. “When playing PowerWash Simulator I refused to spend any of the in-game currency I earned on buying the various upgrades,” says Will Cooling, a 37-year-old diversity manager from the West Midlands. As a boy, Cooling used to help hose down the fridges and workstations at his dad’s butchers – the game reminded him of this, so Cooling sought to play authentically. “It wasn’t like my dad would let me buy new tools if I encountered a bad stain!” he says. Cooling’s refusal to invest in upgrades meant each level took much longer to complete than necessary, but eventually the game forced him to forgo his principles to continue playing. “That broke my immersion,” he says, disappointed that the game refused to reward what he calls, “the digital equivalent of elbow grease”. Abby Marks, a 21-year-old student from Florida, has to pick up litter when she plays survival game The Long Dark. “I spent a lot of time as a kid running around in the woods and seeing the trash that got left all around really bothered me, and I always felt some responsibility to clean it up,” she says. This transferred over into playing the game. Nonetheless, Cooling and Marks can happily play violent games. At the same time that Cooling was playing PowerWash Simulator last summer, he was also enjoying first-person shooter Prodeus. “If I’m playing a more violent game, then that’s the persona I’m playing, and I play to the blood-curdling logic of that game,” he says. He also finds that violent games, “don’t give you as much time to brood on things like morality or purpose because the action is so frenetic”. Still, explicitly violent games can cross the line for some gamers. Seth Katz, a 42-year-old hospital vice-president in Kansas, finds himself unable to harvest the “little sister” characters in the underwater adventure, BioShock, even though doing so would help him upgrade faster in the game. “It just seems wrong,” he says, “It’s not something that happens off screen, but you have to watch your character do it and there are maybe a dozen of these characters in the game so you have to do it over and over and over again.” He is able to “murder” freely in other games, such as Call of Duty and Borderlands, because the enemies are “mindless” and “faceless” and his actions are justified as self-defence. Some games are designed to present gamers with ethical dilemmas – harvesting the little sisters in BioShock results in a “bad” ending, while Red Dead Redemption features morality meters that measure a player’s decisions. Yet many gamers feel ethically conflicted in games that don’t invite this scrutiny. Sarah Taylor, a 34-year-old PR director from Berkshire, played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a vegan in lockdown. “I decided not to kill any animals or eat any animal products in-game,” says Taylor, who went vegan in 2019 after trying out Veganuary. Although she says being vegan in the game started as a joke, she began to take pride in her actions (the secret to not eating virtual meat, she says, is stocking up on radishes and durians). “I was proud that my values carried over to the game. Even though I knew it would make no difference!” Charlotte, a 33-year-old film festival worker from Glasgow, has more specific Zelda rules. While she does eat meat in the game, she doesn’t kill foxes, crows, small birds or goats. She also avoids killing enemies when they’re wearing little backpacks full of fruit. “It feels like they’re kind of busy doing their gathering and not doing any harm. They have to survive in the world like I do,” she argues. “I also don’t attack them when they’re asleep or chatting with their friends round the campfire. There’s something kind of touching the way the interspecies bad guys all hang out together and have their own communities.” Academics have studied our moral choices in video games. In 2012, Baylor University, Texas, media lecturer Daniel Shafer found that players can either be “morally activated” or “morally disengaged” while gaming – the latter being likely to choose “evil” options when playing. The most common justification from this group was that, “it’s just a game”, while morally activated people had empathy for their in-game “victims”. Another study, published in 2010 by academics from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, found that gamers felt guiltier if they engaged in virtual violence that was “unjustified” in the story. Additionally, researchers wrote, “people felt guiltier when they shot video game characters whose private social background was known than when the character’s background was unknown”. Whether any of this affects our real world actions is a debate that’s been going on for decades. Some academics believe that harming animals in video games can contribute to moral indifference toward animals and to their routine mistreatment, while other experts have found that video games don’t lead to violent behaviour. The crossover between the real and the virtual is undoubtedly complex. Though many gamers bring their real world morals into games, things clearly vary from game to game and scenario to scenario. I can’t kill a wolf in Zelda, but I will happily remove the ladder from a Sim’s swimming pool and watch them drown. I can confidently say that I’m unlikely to perform either of these actions in the real world – although, thanks to Zelda, I am sometimes tempted to go into my neighbours’ houses and smash up all their pots."

The retailer opened its highly sought after Christmas delivery slots last week, and the usual frenzy around securing a slot has already begun . In past years, the online retailer has come under fire from disgruntled customers who have struggled to bag a slot for their Xmas shop deliveries, which run between December 20 and 24. A spokesperson for the retailer said: 'We always stagger the release of our festive slots and will begin rolling out this year's Christmas delivery slots from the end of September.

Have yet to receive any notification (and nothing on app) Really concerned will not get slot.' Last year, priority was given to 'Smart Pass' customers when it came to booking the highly desirable slots. Remaining options were offered to non-Smart Pass customers some few weeks later.

2023-10-02,15:09:05+00:00,,The BMW i5 Is The Impossible Burger Of Electric Sedans,https://jalopnik.com/the-bmw-i5-is-the-impossible-burger-of-electric-sedans-1850891676,"There’s a common trope in automotive writing – it’s common to bemoan the death of the ICE, and complain that EVs will never match the soul and spirit of gas-powered cars. Chuck in tacky, if not straight-up hackneyed metaphors comparing electric vehicles to vegan meals; a piece of fruit dressed to look like meat will never be as satisfying as a big juicy steak from some New York steakhouse most readers will ever go to. I mean, I guess, sure. It’s not wrong – gas-powered cars don’t act like EVs. A slice of watermelon grilled and doused in A1 steak sauce and Liquid Smoke is a terribly unsatisfactory approximation of a T-bone steak. It’s silly to assume that a piece of hot watermelon is representative of the entire universe of vegan and vegetarian cuisine. Personally, I think vegan and vegetarian meals are best when they embrace the essence of the ingredients they’re comprised of. Dishes like Palak Paneer and Falafel are god-tier meatless dishes that people seek out because they taste good. They stand on their own merits, they don’t need meat at all, nor does it seem like they’re emulating meat dish. But science has brought meat replacements a long way. There’s no need to play pretend with an acrid piece of slimy watermelon when you can easily get a pack of Impossible Burgers or Beyond Meat patties that taste 95% like ground beef. After driving two different variants of the new BMW i5 around southern Portugal, I’ve realized that the BMW i5 is less falafel and more Impossible Burger. It’s a 5-series that feels mostly normal, but under the skin, it’s metaphorically meatless and therefore better for you. I think that’s a good thing?(NOTE: BMW flew me from my house in Ohio, all the way to Lisbon, Portugal, to test out the i5 which included me confronting my fear of heights by crossing the 486-foot-high Vasco Da Gama bridge.) The BMW i5 is a really important car for the German brand, especially in the US. To my surprise, the 5-series isn’t actually as popular in Europe as one would think – the brand says that its most important markets are the US, South Korea, and China, in that order. It’s also going for volume, which may explain the i5’s lack of boundary-pushing in terms of styling. As the world’s car market becomes increasingly electrified, some automakers seem to have cold feet. Yes, they all talk a big game, but when it comes to producing, electrifying and selling models that sell in big volumes, and not just weird niches of expensive/ugly cars, many are behind. The cough-drop-shaped Mercedes EQE and EQS are offered in parallel to the standard E and S class. If you’re unsure of EV power or don’t like the styling of those two cars, Mercedes-Benz will happily sell you a traditionally styled E or S class sedan. Has it paid off? Eh, it’s not clear, EQ sales are up, but I’d imagine the unconventional styling is a hindrance. Mercedes-Benz has admitted it will soon discontinue these models for more traditionally styled, electrified versions of the C, E, and S class. BMW has beaten Mercedes to this conclusion. Like the i7 and 7-series, the i5 and ICE-powered 5-series look identical. In theory, the normal styling should get more butts into seats, as now they’ll just have to figure out if they can work with an electric vehicle, rather than trying to stomach a car that is very different from its gas-powered equivalent. BMW is aiming for 30% of all 5-series sold worldwide to be the electric i5. If we focus solely on the European market, that number increases to 50%. As far as styling, the i5 is the nicest recent BMW by a landslide. The iX is ugly, and I’ve been vocal about how little I like the i7 and 7-series – that car has a busy front fascia that distracts from the fact its profile and proportions are boring. However, the i5 is genuinely pleasurable to look upon. The side surfacing is refreshingly clean, nothing on the side of the i5 looks overly fussy or overwrought. The car’s proportions are strong, it’s a hair more cab-rearward than the 5-series of yore, but it’s not done so in a way that makes the i5 look like a practically-compromised cartoon drawing. It’s a nice-looking car, it looks either sporty or expensive depending on whether it’s in M guise or luxury trim. The interior is cool, too. It’s not quite as grandiose as the ultra-luxury aspiring i7, but it takes a lot of the good points and applies them in a smaller package. Like the i7, and recently released X1, the i5’s interior feels almost architectural in essence. The interior is filled with lines, angles, and rectilinear forms that are subtly more complicated than they appear at first glance. For example, the main 12.3-inch and 14.9-inch tandem-mounted gauge cluster and infotainment screen may just look like any ol’ screen setup common to nearly every other modern car, but it’s actually a curved display with one of the smallest bezels in the business. A color-changing, geometric crystalline trim that separates the top of the dash from the bottom adds a bit of ambiance to a well-made (if a little pretentious) interior design. BMW is choosing to lead with the i5 instead of the ICE variants of the 5-series, which may fool you into thinking it is a ground-up EV platform. It’s not. Like the i7, the i5 also uses a new variant of the CLAR (Cluster Architecture) platform it used on the outgoing model, re-engineered to accommodate battery electric powertrains seamlessly. It works – like the i7, the i5 makes few ergonomic compromises to accommodate the EV powertrain. Legroom and trunk size are generally identical between the cars. The i5 doesn’t have a weirdly high floor like many cars that are available in both gas and EV form, say, the Genesis G80. Unfortunately, the i5 doesn’t have a frunk, despite having such a long hood. BMW’s penchant for using the same engines and transmissions mostly interchangeably between way different applications in its lineup is alive and well in the electric era. BMW allowed us to drive the single-motor i5 eDrive40, and the dual-motor, M-Performance i5 xDrive M60. The eDrive40 has a similar rear-mounted, 335 horsepower motor, albeit with 295 Ft-Lbs of torque compared to the i4 eDrive40’s 317 ft-lbs. The top-level i5 M60 xDrive uses the same 335 horsepower rear motor but adds a 257 horsepower front motor for a total output of 593 horsepower, and 605 ft-lbs of torque when the boost paddle is pulled. It can be hard to make sense of horsepower numbers these days. When some EV competitors are advertising four-digit horsepower numbers, and motors on each wheel, a measly 335 horsepower from one single motor can seem uncompetitive. But, it isn’t. 335 horsepower is a lot of power, actually. Both the eDrive40 and M60 xDrive are sufficiently swift cars; the eDrive 40 in particular is the most impressive. If you aren’t looking for all-wheel-drive traction (or dual motor power), its single motor and respectable 0-60 time of 5.7 seconds is likely more than any BMW driver would ever need. Impressive, but performance numbers are only part of the picture here. BMW also hired composer Hans Zimmer to create a set of sounds that engender emotion while driving BMW’s EVs. BMW calls it “IconicSounds,” but in layman’s terms, it’s just simulated engine noise. Now, in sport mode, the sounds are a little over-the-top, but the real story is how it behaves in the BMW’s normal modes. Under constant cruising, or light to moderate acceleration, the i5 has a mild throaty buzz that stays proportional to both pedal position and road speed. It’s pleasant, but also very ignorable – the sound feels comfortably like a background element, and not like it’ll overtake a conversation or drown out the stereo. It feels familiar, but not gimmicky or annoying. Importantly, with the sounds enabled, the i5 feels like any other gas car on the market. I’d wager that most drivers wouldn’t even notice that the i5 is electric. Is that a good thing? I don’t know – I personally enjoy EVs that embrace their ultra quiet EV nature and eschew fake engine sounds altogether. But if you’re gonna do it, then do it right. The i5 does it right. Like the i7, the i5 isn’t the lightest vehicle on the road. The low-mounted, heavy battery does wonders for ride comfort, but that excess weight isn’t ideal for driver engagement. However, the i5’s shorter wheelbase, overall smaller dimensions, and suspension and chassis tuning make the i5 feel remarkably engaging. Unlike the i7 M70, where I assert that its additional M-credentials don’t add much aside from power, the M50’s sharper suspension and steering do credibly feel more engaging than the standard model. But, that doesn’t mean the i5 is perfect, though. The i5’s brakes are inconsistent, sometimes they feel great, but other times (especially during hard driving), the changeover from regenerative to friction braking can be abrupt and and feel unrefined. There’s no true one-pedal driving, either. Note: BMW reached out to clarify that “In fact, if you pull the shift toggle back a second time after you’ve engaged Drive, you’ll engage “B” or “brake” mode, which brings up maximum regen and one-pedal driving. If you also engage Auto Hold, you can drive for weeks without ever touching the brake pedal. This feature is present in all of our BEVs.” Although I am generally indifferent to frunks, it is disappointing that the i5 does not have one. BMW i5 program lead admitted that there’s nothing but an empty cavity underneath the hood, particularly in single-motor form, and yet there’s no way to access or use that space. Finally, the EV range is merely okay. It’ll do about 295 miles in eDrive40 form, and 256 in the M60 xDrive – both from an 81.2 kWh (usable) battery. The base i5 eDrive40 starts at $67,795, a steal compared to its closest competitors, the Genesis G80 Electrified, and Mercedes Benz EQE 350+. The i5 has more power than the base EQE, and its low price tag embarrasses the Mercedes Benz and Genesis’s respective roughly $75,000 and $80,000 pricetags. Yet, whereas the G80 comes standard with AWD, or the EQE can be optioned with AWD, buyers are forced to step up to the i5 M60 to get all-weather traction. At $85,095, the i5 M60’s level of luxury and performance is still a bargain compared to AMG versions of the EQE which reach into the six-figure range. Most importantly, a base i5 is about $9,000 more expensive than a base gas-powered 530i. Expensive, but priced close enough that a traditional gas car buyer could be swayed to make the jump to electric. In short, the i5 feels a lot like the 5-series we’ve always known, it just so happens to be electric. It’s a lot like the first time I took a bite of an impossible burger – I came in expecting to hate the thing, thinking it’d be a poor emulation of a well-loved favorite. Instead, I found a shockingly convincing meat replacement that was generally pretty yummy. It wasn’t perfect, but I’d definitely eat it again. The BMW i5 might be the vehicle to turn the brand’s EVs from niche player to volume seller."
