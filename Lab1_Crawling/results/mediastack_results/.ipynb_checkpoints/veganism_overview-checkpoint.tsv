This summer, we in Clark County have been besieged by the aides aegypti mosquito. They mostly lay their eggs in standing water. The washes throughout the county are full of just that. Isn’t it time for the powers that be to institute a mosquito abatement plan? Public health is at risk.
2023-10-07	10:39:31+00:00	By Jess Fleming | jfleming@pioneerpress.com | Pioneer Press	Five great veggie burgers that won’t have you missing the meat	https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/07/five-great-veggie-burgers-that-wont-have-you-missing-the-meat/	Over the years, I’ve gotten more than a few emails from readers asking me where they can get a good veggie burger. And though I really appreciate a great one, I find that many restaurants either serve a pre-made patty or a flavorless facsimile thereof. But lately, I’ve been researching regular burgers for our annual burger guide, and where there’s a house-made veggie burger on the menu, I make a point to order it alongside the beef version. I can’t recommend all of them, but I did find five meatless burgers that I would order again. Please note that I am a meat eater and prefer real cheese if I can get it, so this is not a vegan burger list. I think this rice-and-bean-based burger is probably the one I liked the best from this list. Properly spiced (even a little spicy!), smashed like the trendy beef patties and topped with American cheese, caramelized onions, French onion dip, tomato and onion (and a fried egg if you want it), it’s filling and delicious and did not make me feel like I was missing out on something better. I also loved that I could pair this with a delicious margarita and fried Brussels sprouts from Centro, which shares space with Everywhen in St. Paul. Everywhen Burger Bar: 750 S. Cleveland Ave., St. Paul, 612-489-5558; or 2412 Nicollet Ave., Minneapolis, 612-452-9785; everywhenburgers.com The solo version of J. Selby’s infamous Dirty Double is the only pure vegan burger on this list, but it’s not the only one I tried. It is on this list because it’s the only vegan burger that did not make me, as a meat and cheese lover, grimace when I took a bite. It’s a little sorcery that allows the very meat-like patty and very cheese-like cheese to taste like the real thing, and I’m not sure I really want to peel back the curtain. Taste-wise, this is just a really simple, really good burger, topped with vegan cheese and mayo, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion and served with really good fries. If you’re vegan or vegetarian (or just really like veggie burgers) and haven’t been here, you’re really missing out. J. Selby’s: 169 N. Victoria St., St. Paul; 651-222-3263; jselbys.com This brewery, with its magical, art-stuffed patio, just keeps getting better. It recently added a full kitchen and is serving burgers and other casual fare along with its delicious wood-fired pizzas. We weren’t over the moon for the regular burger (it was a little dry), but the black bean burger is fantastic. The earthy patty has plenty of spice and lots of interesting, flavorful crispy bits and is topped with guacamole, which added some needed moisture, caramelized onion for a little sweetness and lettuce and tomato for freshness. There’s plenty of inside seating, too, if the weather isn’t cooperating. St. Paul Brewing: 688 E. Minnehaha Ave., St. Paul; 651-698-1945; stpaulbrewing.com I always forget about this spot, tucked into the sleepy St. Anthony neighborhood on the border of St. Paul and Minneapolis. It reminds me of the coffee shops I liked to frequent in my college years, but with better food. I really liked that this patty is walnut-based, and you can definitely taste the nuts. I was bummed that the restaurant was out of buns when we visited, but even on toast, this was a tasty burger, topped with cheddar, hummus, greens, onion and tomato. Especially when served on toast, the hummus and nutty patty made it a little un-burger-like, but the fact that it was undeniably delicious kept it on the list. Finnish Bistro: 2264 Como Ave., St. Paul; 651-645-9181; finnishbistro.com One of the few things on Sea Salt’s menu that isn’t seafood is its walnut-cheese burger, and it was so good that I’m including it on this list even though you’ll have to wait until next season to get it. (The Minneapolis Parks restaurant next to Minnehaha Falls closed for the season last weekend.) It’s just a really good, nutty veggie burger (the cheese is inside the patty), topped with lettuce, tomato and onion and served with a side of the restaurant’s super tasty creamy coleslaw. I’m convinced that everything tastes better when eaten overlooking the falls, but who am I to count that against them? Let’s start the countdown until they’re open again.

While on the surface, these two sports icons may seem like an unlikely duo, their friendship dates back to 2013 and they have always held a mutual respect for each other’s work. One might wonder how Ibrahimovic, the soccer legend, and Djokovic, the men’s tennis world number one, could find common ground. It is true that Ibrahimovic does not agree with the principles that Djokovic adheres to. However, this has not prevented Ibra from recognizing Djokovic’s achievements. Recently the 24x Grand Slam champion attended a UCL match between his home club, Red Star Belgrade, and Young Boys. His friend, Ibrahimovic on the other hand sat in an exclusive interview with renowned television personality Piers Morgan. During the interview, Morgan asked Ibrahimovic about his thoughts on Djokovic as an athlete. The ex-MLS star known for his straightforward nature, did not hold back. He stated, “I think he’s an amazing, amazing example for what he’s doing”. However, the $500 million rich athlete did not shy away from pointing out their differences. He acknowledged, “We have different philosophies. And he has all these things he does to perform. And it and for him doing that is doing an individual sport. I was doing a collective sport”. One notable difference that Ibrahimovic mentioned is Djokovic’s commitment to a vegan lifestyle. “He’s a vegan. He does this, things getting energy from different kinds of things. I’m not 100% in it. I’m opposite,” added the 42-year-old. 1.3k readers Last 30 min October 07, 2023 05:38 pm EDT October 08, 2023 03:52 pm EDT October 09, 2023 09:17 am EDT October 09, 2023 01:14 pm EDT October 09, 2023 08:58 am EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest Tennis stories via Google! Click on Follow Us and Tap the Blue Star. The ex-PSG superstar then gave a look into his ideology. “Those things doesn’t change me. I change my own game,” said Ibrahimovic. “You tell me good luck. I don’t need luck to perform. I decide when to perform good, I am in control to do good or bad”. The Puskas winner then concluded: “That is what I believe in. I don’t need to knock wood three times to go out and it brings me luck”. This strong statement reveals Ibrahimovic’s independent mindset and his ability to excel on his own terms. This is a mindset fans have got to see from the Swedish striker throughout his career. It is this unwavering determination that allows him to boldly proclaim himself as the greatest soccer player of all time. “You Don’t Ask the Young Guys for Respect” – Forced to Join Al Nassr, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Chaotic Spell Detailed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic In soccer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have dominated the narrative of the GOAT debate for decades. However, in an unprecedented move, Zlatan Ibrahimovic boldly proclaimed himself as the most complete player in history. During his conversation with Piers Morgan, Ibrahimovic was questioned about his position among the all-time greats. Enjoyed Your Read?

The car repair shop is near Silver Lake (in Los Angeles), so I stopped by my favorite ice cream shop, Creamo—which also happens to double as a donut shop called Donut Friend. Here's what I chose: Nutella-Vision (raised donut, chocolate hazelnut spread, olive oil, and sea salt) Rocky Roadolato (dark chocolate ice cream, toasted almonds, Dandies marshmallows) It was all divine–so rich and creamy and delicious! I highly recommend pretty much any of their ice creams or donuts. You can also get ice cream sandwiches (made with donuts), sundaes, and milkshakes of all kinds. Oh, and I forgot to mention—every single thing is 100% vegan! But you would never know it! Creamo has been featured in VegNews, which describes the wonderous ice cream: With a dedication to pushing the boundaries of flavor, this Los Angeles scoop shop features a mesmerizing array of unique and decadent creations. From their heavenly X-Ray Speculoos with swirls of cookie butter to the pop punk-named Paramoreo, each scoop is a blissful explosion of taste and texture that will leave you craving more. In a separate article, VegNews interviewed owner Mark Trombino, who described his passion for ice cream: "Ice cream has always been a huge passion of mine—more so than doughnuts if you can believe that; however, I haven't really found any vegan ice cream that knocks me out, and that was a bummer," Trombino told VegNews. "So I decided to see if I could come up with my own … I was looking for something that didn't taste like an alternative milk, and was rich and creamy and had the mouth feel of a dairy ice cream." For more information, check out Creamo's website or Instagram. And if you're ever in Los Angeles, go try it for yourself, I promise you'll love it! this is what LA dreams are made of. #donut#vegan#vegandonut Snack-cake mogul Little Debbie is on fire lately (pun intended)!

Dr Helen Hutchinson, social scientist and spokesperson for environmental group Flight Free Australia, believes flying should be scrapped entirely until it's 'safe' or emission-free. 'It's an individual action – it's the worst thing you can do,' Dr Hutchinson told 3AW's Tom Elliott on Thursday. 'A lot of that's due to the fact we've prioritised air [travel]. A lot of other countries have actually put an equal amount of money into ground transport - such as really good buses, really good trains - and we could've done the same in Australia.' Dr Helen Hutchinson, social scientist and spokesperson for environmental group Flight Free Australia, believes flying should be scrapped entirely until it's 'safe' or emission-free 'When you look at what's happening in Australia now, most of our long-distance trains have been privatised,' she continued. Elliott then questioned the activist on time constraints, explaining he gets a 'week off at this time of year' in which he spent six days in Queensland with his family. 'Now, if we'd driven it's a two-day drive there and a two-day drive back which only leaves two days to enjoy it. It's just not possible,' he argued. 'Well, there's places in the world now where they're asking employers to give people time to get to the destination. And you can go [to Queensland] by train,' Dr Hutchinson said. The host then cuts Dr Hutchinson off, remarking that it still takes two days to get to Queensland by train to which the activist simply responds: 'Yep, I've just done it.' 'What I'm suggesting is maybe you can ask for an extra four days which you can travel there and travel back,' she added. Modern day Australia couldn't exist without flying, Elliott responded. Modern day Australia couldn't exist without flying, 3AW host Tom Elliott told a Flight Free Australia activist 'The Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane air corridor is one of the busiest in the world, and people want to be able to commute and fly between the cities,' he said. 'A lot of modern business and so forth works because of that. You're saying merely we just shouldn't do that?' Dr Hutchinson said their phone call was an example of how long-distance communication is available in other forms, with a lot of businesses turning to video calling platforms off the back of the pandemic. 'It's not difficult to change your behaviours if you just look at the other options, and what we're encouraging people to do is to just look at the other options,' she continued. 'I went to university in the UK, and every couple of years I like to go visit old friends there - am I allowed to do that or is that not allowed?' Elliott then asked. 'I'm not making a choice for you, as for the people who have joined Flight Free Australia made that choice not to fly until it's safe to do so,' the activist said. 'One of the big problems with emissions is the aviation fuel, and aviation is one of the very few industries where we don't have an alternate means of energy.' Elliott then asked whether Flight Free Australia would prefer if long-distance travel reverted back to using ships regardless of the drawn-out travel times. The activist did not respond, before quietly asking 'does it sound good to you?' 'Well, not really. I don't have the time,' he laughed. 'I don't have the time to be travelling two weeks on a ship to get there. I don't think the world is like that anymore.' 'I think what we have to look at is the alternative,' Dr Hutchinson said. 'We're actually living in a climate emergency right now, and every small amount of emissions we can possibly save we really have to do. It's not a question of what we might like to do, it's a question of what we have to do.' Commerical flights have long since been a point of contention for climate change activists, with Jean-Marc Jancovici proposing a universal quota should be imposed on air travel earlier this year. The French engineer and climate activist said people should be limited to four long haul flights in their lifetime in order to mitigate climate change. The call to restrict flying comes as environmentalists were slammed this week after suggesting dogs should go vegan. Research by the University of Winchester found cats and dogs consume about 9 per cent of all land animals killed for food – about 7 billion animals annually – as well as billions of fish and aquatic animals, The Guardian reported. If all the world's dogs went vegan it would save more greenhouse gas emissions than those produced by the UK, it would free up a larger land mass than Mexico and more freshwater than all the renewable freshwater in Denmark, and would feed about 450 million additional people, the research claimed. If all the world's cats went vegan, it would save more emissions than those produced by New Zealand, land larger than Germany, freshwater exceeding all renewable freshwater in Jordan, and would feed about 70 million additional people. The revelation was regarded as 'tragic' by editorial cartoonist Johannes Leak on Thursday evening. '[Dogs] don't get that much out of life, it's all about meat and walks you know and they want to take even the meat out of the diet,' he told Sky News host Chris Kenny. 'It's just tragic.

2023-10-05	22:47:37+00:00		Is This The End Of The Diet Wars?	https://www.laweekly.com/is-this-the-end-of-the-diet-wars/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-this-the-end-of-the-diet-wars	Nutritionists and health gurus have long fought over which diet is the greatest. From keto vs. vegetarianism, to vegan vs. carnivore diets, the diet wars have waged on. Bringing a well-researched and unbiased perspective to the table, Matt Gallant and Wade Lightheart’s The Ultimate Nutrition Bible is the book that will bring peace to the nutrition world. The diet wars. Whether you have passionate feelings on the topic of keto vs. vegetarianism, or you’ve simply been trying to sift through all the arguments to get at what diet is right for you, the nutrition world needs a fresh, unbiased perspective: one that focuses less on pushing one diet over them all and more on the specific person looking to take on an effective nutrition plan. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible, co-authored by Matt Gallant and Wade Lightheart, stands to do just that. Lightheart, a long-time vegetarian bodybuilder, and Gallant, a strength and conditioning coach who personally swears by keto, have come together to take the guesswork (and dogma) out of choosing the diet that aligns with your goals, psychology, and genetics. When the pair first met, Lightheart was a successful trainer and was winning National Natural Bodybuilding Championships on a plant-based diet (to the shock of a bodybuilding community that thought little of vegetarianism). Gallant, on the keto path since the age of 16, was also finding great results as a personal trainer. Jokingly describing each other as “zealots” when it came to their nutrition plans, the early years of their friendship were rooted in passionate debate. “We argued all the time about food, diets, and religion,” Gallant recalls. But instead of this story being par for the course with the rest of the diet wars, the two were actually able to grow from the other person’s perspective. “At some point,” Gallant continues, “we realized that we both were achieving good success and that both of these diets were not working for everyone.” Gallant recalls some of his clients at the time having digestive problems with keto – while Lightheart was having similar problems while adapting a meat eater’s approach to a high-performance vegetarian diet. “It took Matt and I about four years to completely resolve our arguments about digestive health. We argued results and data until we determined that these fringe areas – outside the standard deviation of success parameters – are the conflicting aspects. Almost all experts just want to avoid that.” Simply put, the reasons that diets succeed or fail comes down to nuance: there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible combines 20 years of research and experience from both Gallant and Lightheart – and teaches readers how to find the nutrition plan that actually fits them. The idea that we all have different nutritional needs, strengths, and weaknesses as human beings seems obvious when said aloud, but then why do the diet wars rage on in fitness centers, grocery aisles, and online forums? It comes down to dogma. “We’re all seeking tribes,” Gallant says, “but to seek a tribe based on the diet type you’re on doesn’t make sense. Obviously, there is a lot of money in nutrition, so it’s in the best interest of many diet gurus to create a tribe of zealots that will tell the world that their thing is the best thing.” For those seeking a nutrition plan that actually yields long-term results, it’s best to trade this tribal thinking for something more individualistic to you. As an antidote to picking a side in the diet wars, Lightheart and Gallant suggest honing in on your specific goals, psychology, and genetics. Everyone is looking for a different impact from their diet. Some seek to increase their lifespan, while others strive to compete athletically at the highest level. Some of us are simply wanting to feel and look good in our bodies. For performance or aesthetics, different goals are going to warrant different nutritional plans. Then, we have psychology to look at. The right diet for you is going to be structured in a way that actually appeals to you. The insight of The Ultimate Nutrition Bible is designed to help you for life, so you need to understand your personality, habits, and lifestyle in order to find a nutrition plan that you can see yourself following to your old age. This ensures that you’re sailing with the wind, not against it. Finally, genetics plays a large role – which is where Lightheart and Gallant’s research has taken them deep into the world of Nutrigenetics. Along with help from friends and colleagues who are experts in this area, the authors explore this emerging science – believed to be one of the biggest game changers in the world of nutrition. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible In a nutshell, we all have mutations or genetic variants. Some of these are positive and some are negative. By coming to an awareness of our genetic dispositions, we can lean into our strengths and incorporate nutrition in a way that counters our weaknesses. “Eventually, every diet is going to get exposed for its liabilities relative to your genetics,” Lightheart explains, “but it might be the best one that you can do. From there, you can calibrate and tweak in order to limit those liabilities.” This recognition of liabilities highlights the damaging impact of the diet wars. There is no silver bullet for nutrition – and those who say that become blind to the tradeoffs that exist in every diet. By taking an unbiased approach – one can actually do something about the liabilities in their diet as it pertains to their genetics. Getting to that unbiased, universal perspective was Wade Lightheart and Matt Gallant’s goal from the start. The Ultimate Nutrition Bible won’t just end the diet wars – it will disrupt the nutrition industry for years to come.

Korean food has only been growing in-demand in Britain, with restaurants popping up across London and videos of Korean Corn Dogs garnering 83.9 million views on TikTok alone. So, it only made sense for the restaurant chain to give the British public what they have been craving. The pan-Asian chain's menu has had a major shake up, introducing hot pots, tteokbokki and many more delicious dishes. Wagamama launched a new menu on October 4, gracing customers with a range of new Korean-inspired dishes On October 4 the restaurant launched its Korean-infused menu with the hopes of pushing the envelope further with their innovative dishes. Wagamama also announced their first TV advertisement at the same time as the daring new menu, which is their first since 2021. The pan-Asian chain hopes the new menu will leave customers satisfied and rejuvenated after every dive into their warm bowls. Among the new cutting-edge items up for grabs is the vegan k dog - the restaurant's take on a popular Korean street food classic. The corn dog is encased in a crispy noodle crumb coating, and dished up with a fiery sriracha sauce, as well as a zesty turmeric vegan mayo. Among items gracing the restaurant's menu for the first time are nourishing hot pots, drowned in a hearty Korean-inspired broth. Not only does the warm bowl come with ttoekbokki and vegetables, but tofu, chicken or premium cut steak can be added depending on your taste buds. You can even opt for a popular spicy rice cake alongside it, if it takes your fancy. Another new addition to the list is their perfectly-balanced gochujang rice bowls, that similarly to the hot pot come with steak, tofu or chicken. The chain have introduced perfectly-balanced gochujang rice bowls (pictured) that can be dished up with steak, tofu or chicken Wagamama's have also included their own take on the famous Korean corn dog, in the form of the vegan k-dog (pictured left). The restaurant are also plating up heartwarming hot pots (pictured right), coupled with steaming Korean-inspired broth The bowls bursting with the spicy yet sweet gochujang flavours are plated up with crunchy vegetables, snow onions and pickled onions. But it is not just mains that will see as a change, as Wagamama fans will spot an array of new sides on menu's across the nation. Hungry fans will be pleased to see crispy rotis served with raisukatsu sauce, as well as king oyster mushroom skewers on the menu. But the pan-Asian restaurant has not forgotten about those with a sweet tooth either, offering customers crispy chouxnuts pumped with kuromitsu black honey or sweet matcha for dessert. Global executive chef, Steve Mangleshot said: 'We designed the new menu to nourish and rejuvenate our guests and to tap into the cultural and social trends that are exciting people in 2023. 'For this reason, we have been inspired by mouthwatering Korean flavours and street foods. 'Our test kitchen is constantly working to create innovative, sustainable and groundbreaking dishes and our chefs are excited to showcase their skills and serve up the new dishes.' The new menu announcement comes after Wagamama launched the UK's first vegan fish and chips. The chain put their own Japanese twist on a British classic by selling Tempura F-ish + Bang Bang Yaki-imo. The flavour-packed dish saw classic Beer battered fish swapped out for a lightly tempura coated 'f-ish', made from a concoction of pea protein, rice and soy in an attempt to recreate its flaky texture. The Asian-inspired restaurant also took a swing at recreating their own version of the classic takeaway chip, by combining red onion and sweet potato chunks. The imitation of the British takeaway staple did not stop there, as the chain also re-imagined the trimmings, smashing edamame beans as a unique take on mushy peas.

But the pan-Asian restaurant has not forgotten about those with a sweet tooth either, offering customers crispy chouxnuts pumped with kuromitsu black honey or sweet matcha for dessert. Global executive chef, Steve Mangleshot said: 'We designed the new menu to nourish and rejuvenate our guests and to tap into the cultural and social trends that are exciting people in 2023. 'For this reason, we have been inspired by mouthwatering Korean flavours and street foods. 'Our test kitchen is constantly working to create innovative, sustainable and groundbreaking dishes and our chefs are excited to showcase their skills and serve up the new dishes.' The new menu announcement comes after Wagamama launched the UK's first vegan fish and chips. The chain put their own Japanese twist on a British classic by selling Tempura F-ish + Bang Bang Yaki-imo. The flavour-packed dish saw classic Beer battered fish swapped out for a lightly tempura coated 'f-ish', made from a concoction of pea protein, rice and soy in an attempt to recreate its flaky texture. The Asian-inspired restaurant also took a swing at recreating their own version of the classic takeaway chip, by combining red onion and sweet potato chunks. The imitation of the British takeaway staple did not stop there, as the chain also re-imagined the trimmings, smashing edamame beans as a unique take on mushy peas.

We've received your submission. Men have beef with eating vegan. A new study shows that fewer men are adopting vegan diets because they don’t think the lifestyle is “manly” enough. Alma Scholz, who worked with the University of Würzburg, in Germany to produce the findings, enlisted 539 people to explore their opinions of plant-based food and its relation to gender. “Men might be less inclined to consume vegan food due to the need to appear masculine,” explained Scholz, now based at the University of Stockholm in Sweden. “Perhaps if we used even more masculine language to describe this food, we could make men more willing to eat it,” Sholz added. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Communication on Wednesday, asked participants to rate four vegan meals on how suitable they were for men or women on a scale from one to seven. On average, more people in the study found that meals consisting of a vegan burger, salad, carbonara, and goulash were more suitable for women than men. Researchers hypothesize that targeted marketing for women could play a role. Half of the study’s participants were given more “masculine” language to describe food. Some were told the vegan burger was called a “beast burger” instead of a “wow-factor burger.” Other traditionally masculine adjectives included words like “smokey” and “hardy” versus neutral words like creamy and delicious. When people were given the more masculine terms, they rated the food as slightly less suitable for women — though not entirely. But even with more masculine names, men viewed vegan food as more suitable for women overall. Researchers employed a 1 to 7 scale for rating foods, with 1 being the most feminine and 7 being the most masculine; a middling 4 was considered neutral, neither manly nor womanly. When participants were fed non-gendered language, the average rating for the vegan meals was 3.68. When terms like “beast,” “smokey,” and “hardy” were used, the average rating went up to 3.98, meaning it was thought to be equally suitable for both genders. While male assessments proved to be influenced by language, women were relatively unswayed by the various descriptions, regardless of their gendered associations. The study authors blamed cultural stereotypes and traditional gender roles for people’s views on diet. “In particular, meat consumption is linked to gender stereotypes of masculinity, probably explaining men’s lower willingness to adopt plant-based diets,” the authors wrote. “Meat is associated with strength and potency, which makes meat appear more suitable for men: ‘Men are strong, men need to be strong, thus men need meat,’” the study continued. The authors also looked at the diets of people in Germany and found that just 5% of the population follows a vegetarian diet and only 1% are vegan. The vegetarian diet is more widespread among women, who account for 6.1% versus just 2.5% of men. And only 19% of all vegans are men. Nevertheless, vegetarian and vegan diets “have been shown to be associated with lower risk of chronic diseases,” researchers noted in their report, suggesting that companies reconsider how they advertise plant-based foods to appear to more men. However, the real reason for a carnivorous dietary preference might be in our genes, according to another study published in the journal Plos One on Wednesday. Scientists from Northwestern University found that people who identified as mainly vegetarian still ate some meat and fish — and genetics may be to blame. “It seems there are more people who would like to be vegetarian than actually are, and we think it’s because there is something hard-wired here that people may be missing,” study co-author Nabeel Yaseen said in a news release. The study authors found three genes linked to vegetarianism and another 31 genes potentially linked to a plant-based diet. “My speculation is there may be lipid component(s) present in meat that some people need. And maybe people whose genetics favor vegetarianism are able to synthesize these components endogenously,” Yaseen added. Scientists found that the way people metabolize meat varies from person to person and something in meat might actually make people crave it. The scientists used alcohol as an example. They said while people may not like drinking alcoholic beverages at first they get a taste for it over time. “I think with meat, there’s something similar. Perhaps you have a certain component – I’m speculating a lipid component – that makes you need it and crave it,” Yaseen said.

2023-10-05	08:05:29+00:00	Victoria Allen	Men won't go vegan because they don't think it's MANLY, scientists say	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12593945/Men-wont-vegan-dont-think-MANLY-scientists-say.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490	 Published: 05:00 BST, 5 October 2023 | Updated: 09:05 BST, 5 October 2023 Men are less likely to be vegans than women because the diet is not seen as masculine, a study suggests. There is evidence that men are far less willing than women to give up steaks and barbecues for a trendy vegan diet. To understand why, researchers asked 539 people to rate four vegan meals on a scale of how suitable they were for men or for women. The vegan burger, carbonara, goulash and salad were described, on average, as being more appropriate for women to eat than men. But the study suggests a vegan diet could appear less emasculating for men if it used more red-blooded language. Men are less likely to be vegans than women because the diet is not seen as masculine, a study suggests (stock image) Half the people in the study were given masculine descriptions of the food, like a 'beast burger' rather than a 'wow-factor burger' or a hearty goulash instead of a gourmet one. The man-friendly descriptions of the food included the words smoky, greasy and juicy, with the burger and carbonara described as coming in a 'massive portion' for 'even the biggest appetite'. People given manly descriptions of the vegan meals rated them as less suitable for women than men given neutral descriptions like 'creamy' and 'delicious'. This suggests more masculine marketing of vegan foods could make them seem less girly. But even though people saw vegan foods as less feminine when they had masculine names and descriptions, they still rated the meals as slightly more suitable for women than men. Unfortunately they were also no more likely to say they would like to eat the vegan meal, would be willing to try it, or thought it would taste good. Alma Scholz, who led the study from the University of Würzburg but is now based at Stockholm University, said: 'Men might be less inclined to consume vegan food due to the need to appear masculine. 'Perhaps if we used even more masculine language to describe this food, we could make men more willing to eat it.' Figures show that just 3.82 per cent of men are vegan, while almost one in 10 (9.4 per cent) women now follow the diet The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Communication, asked people to rate the suitability of vegan food for men of women from one to seven. A score of four meant it was not particularly suitable for either sex, with a higher score meaning it was more suitable for men and a score below four meaning it was more suitable for women. When a burger was described to half the volunteers using neutral words, the average rating was 3.68. But the rating rose to 3.98 from people, to whom it was described using more masculine words - meaning it was almost seen as a meal equally suitable for both men and women. Men appear very sensitive to whether food might make them look like less of a man, based on the study findings. Women's ratings of whether vegan food is more suitable for males or females did not significantly change when masculine descriptions were used - but men's did. The study authors note that meat is culturally associated with strength and masculinity, which might make a vegan diet a hard-sell. According to scientists, switching to plant-based products that mimic real meat can help the planet. Livestock farming at the current rate hurt the environment in a number of different ways. Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming. Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change. Juicy Marbles is just one firm creating plant-based vegan products, which are increasingly taking space on the supermarket shelves Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast. As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. Scientists have recently suggested that bringing plant-based meat to public institutions such as schools and prisons can help trigger a wider transition amongst the general public. 'Favouring alternative proteins in public procurement policies globally could help to bring forward tipping points in their adoption,' they say in a report. Did YOU get the alert?

2023-10-05	05:32:32+00:00		76-Year-Old Arnold Schwarzenegger, Who Is 80% Vegan Now, Makes Exceptions During UFC Fights for Bizarre Reasons: “It Somehow Fits Together”	https://www.essentiallysports.com/bodybuilding-news-year-old-arnold-schwarzenegger-who-is-vegan-now-makes-exceptions-during-ufc-fights-for-bizarre-reasons-it-somehow-fits-together/	As the human body ages, we need to make several changes in our diet, training, and other aspects of our lifestyle to adapt to the changes. While this can be overwhelming at first, listening to the body should be the first priority. Even seven-time Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is known as the beacon of fitness and bodybuilding, had to give up in front of time. Despite being 76, Schwarzenegger maintains an active lifestyle and trains daily. However, with time, he had to make a crucial change in his diet. A bodybuilder’s diet typically consists of a lot of meat and eggs. However, this can lead to high cholesterol and blood pressure-related problems. In a recent podcast, The Rich Roll Podcast, Schwarzenegger revealed that he has cut down his meat consumption by up to 70 percent. However, there is still a special occasion on which he does not hesitate to consume some steak. To ensure proper recovery and muscle hypertrophy, athletes and bodybuilders often rely on meat and eggs as the primary source of protein. However, they are also responsible for increasing the chances of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. While Schwarzenegger has already faced his share of heart troubles, doctors suggested he cut down on his meat consumption to ensure a healthy lifestyle. Arnold Schwarzenegger once wrote in his newsletter Arnold’s Pump Club, “I’m not fully vegan. I just eat about 80 percent less meat than I used to. For protein, my staples are eggs, salmon, and chicken”. His diet consists more of Vegan food now, while he also consumes a lot more veggies than before. However, ‘The Austrian Oak’ admits that on some occasions, he does consume a few pieces of steak. He admitted, “My diet is pretty much… I would say around 70 percent, I cut down my meat intake. And the other 30 percent is on it because of, every so often, I, once a month maybe, I make a steak at home when we watch the UFC fight. It somehow fits together, with all the mid-up to the screen.” But what is the reason behind this? Let’s take a look. 1.3k readers Last 30 min October 09, 2023 10:09 am EDT October 07, 2023 09:00 am EDT October 09, 2023 12:31 pm EDT October 09, 2023 01:11 pm EDT October 09, 2023 01:40 pm EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest UFC stories via Google! Click on Follow Us and Tap the Blue Star. Schwarzenegger confessed that it was the need of his aging body that reduced his consumption of meat. He revealed, “I’m at an age where I should just cut back because my cholesterol level should come down a little bit, and blood pressure and all of that.” Enjoyed Your Read? Let us know how likely you are to recommend EssentiallySports to your friends! Adding to this, he also stated that multiple UFC fighters are vegetable-based. Talking further, Arnold disclosed that it was Jim (James Cameron) who motivated him to reduce his meat consumption. ‘Arnie’ stated that Jim made him realize that 25–28 percent of pollution comes from livestock. All these factors combined finally led Schwarzenegger to decide to switch to a vegetable-based diet. What are your views on this? Let us know in the comments.
2023-10-05	05:18:16+00:00	Web Editor	Northwestern professor find genetics could influence vegetarianism	https://dailynorthwestern.com/2023/10/05/campus/northwestern-professor-find-genetics-could-influence-vegetarianism/	Sign up to receive our email newsletter in your inbox. Given a substantial rise in plant-based diets, few metropolitan areas today lack restaurants boasting vegetarian or vegan options. However, despite an apparent increase in the number of people identifying as vegetarian, a recent Northwestern Medicine study found that an individual’s genetic makeup has a major impact on whether they have the ability to maintain a vegetarian diet. The study, led by Feinberg Prof. Nabeel Yaseen, is the fully peer-reviewed, indexed study to explore the link between vegetarianism and genetics. About 48%-64% of those who claim to maintain a vegetarian diet do, in fact, report eating some meat, according to Yaseen’s study, which was published Oct. 4 in science journal PLOS ONE. Yaseen said he believes this statistic reflects the fact that biological qualities can prevent some from holding to vegetarianism. “Are all humans capable of subsisting long term on a strict vegetarian diet?” Yaseen said in a Wednesday news release. “This is a question that has not been seriously studied.” Yaseen investigated this question in his recent study, which identified three genes that have a significant association with vegetarianism, as well as 31 others that possibly are associated. Some of the genes, including two of the genes with the highest association, are involved in fat metabolism and brain function. There are more people who wish to become vegetarian than actually are, and a genetic factor is to blame, Yaseen said in the release. Yaseen’s study could pave the way for future investigations into how genetics influence an individual’s ability to maintain vegetarianism. “We hope that future studies will lead to a better understanding of the physiologic differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians, thus enabling us to provide personalized dietary recommendations and to produce better meat substitutes,” Yaseen said.
2023-10-04	19:34:05+00:00	Danny Halpin	Switching pets to vegan diets could benefit environment, study suggests	https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/pets-cats-dogs-vegan-food-diet-b2424139.html	Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile If the world’s dogs and cats switched to vegan diets then billions of animals would be spared from slaughter every year with greenhouse gas emissions savings equal to those produced by Saudi Arabia or Australia, a new study estimates. Extending strictly vegan diets to all humans could also create calorie savings that would feed everyone on Earth. This is because 6kg of plant protein are required to produce 1kg of high-quality animal protein so cutting out livestock would mean there are more calories available for people – and pets. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have shown dogs and cats can lead healthy lives on nutritionally sound plant-based diets provided they are made to contain essential nutrients normally found in meat. To safeguard health it’s important that people feed only vegan pet food labelled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards Researchers have now begun to quantify the environmental impact of pet diets and how that could change if they went vegan. Professor Andrew Knight of Griffith University, Australia, estimates this would stop the slaughter of around seven billion livestock animals and billions more aquatic creatures. It would also free up vast tracts of land that could be rewilded allowing nature to recover and reduce pollution from animal faeces that often spills into rivers and lakes, further damaging ecosystems. A 2018 estimate put the global dog population at 471 million with the collective weight of all canines equal to that of all the remaining wild land mammals. Vegan pet diets are usually formed from plants but they could in future also be made using yeast, fungi or seaweed, as some companies are using to develop meat alternatives for humans. Prof Knight said: “This study shows environmental benefits when vegan diets are used to feed not just people, but dogs and cats as well. “However, to safeguard health it’s important that people feed only vegan pet food labelled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards.” He also stressed that the pet population and animal energy requirement data he used might underestimate the true environmental benefits of vegan diets and that he had to make some assumptions, so more research is required to make his findings more reliable. For example, Prof Knight referenced US data when working out global dietary ingredients instead of working out all the various national differences. He also estimated environmental impacts using data from 2009-2011 which, if more recent, would give more accurate results.

2023-10-04	19:00:00+00:00		Adoption of vegan dog and cat diets could have environmental benefits	http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/799825/?sc=rsla	Request an expert contact, get responses directly to your inbox The new analysis estimates a variety of potential benefits for environmental sustainability—for instance, reduced freshwater consumption and greenhouse gas emissions—that could result from switching all pet dogs and cats in the US or around the world to nutritionally sound, vegan diets. Newswise — A new analysis estimates a variety of potential benefits for environmental sustainability—for instance, reduced freshwater consumption and greenhouse gas emissions—that could result from switching all pet dogs and cats in the US or around the world to nutritionally sound, vegan diets. Andrew Knight of Griffith University, Australia, presents these calculations in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on October 4, 2023. The livestock industry has environmental impacts, such as land and freshwater consumption and emission of pollutants. However, while many prior studies have focused on livestock impacts in relation to human diets, few have considered the relative role of cat and dog diets. Recent research suggests that nutritionally sound vegan cat and dog diets—lacking meat, eggs, and dairy—are safe and may have comparable healthfulness to meat-based diets, raising questions about their environmental benefits. To better understand these potential benefits, Knight calculated a series of estimates of the potential impacts of a hypothetical scenario in which all cats and dogs in the US or around the world were switched to nutritious vegan diets. He used pet population data from 2020 for the US and 2018 data for the worldwide estimates. Other inputs came from a variety of prior studies and governmental databases. The estimates suggest that the amount of livestock consumed by dogs and cats in the US may be about one fifth of that consumed by humans, and about one tenth globally. If all US dogs and cats switched to vegan diets, the model estimates, nearly 2 billion land-based livestock animals might be spared from slaughter yearly, and nearly 7 billion if all cats and dogs around the world switched. Billions of aquatic animals would also be spared. The estimates also suggest significant potential reductions in land and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, use of biocides, and emissions of other pollutants. For instance, switching all dogs worldwide to vegan diets could free up an area of land larger than Saudi Arabia, and for cats, larger than Germany; for comparison, if all humans became vegan, an amount of land larger than Russia and India combined might be spared. Switching all dogs’ diets could result in an estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions greater than the amount of all emissions from the UK, and for cats, Israel. The author notes that the pet population and animal energy requirement data he used might underestimate true numbers, so the true environmental benefits of vegan diets might be greater than estimated. However, he also notes that the calculations required making some assumptions, and that more research is needed to bolster confidence in the estimates. For instance, the analysis applied US data on various diet ingredients to the global calculations, instead of accounting for national differences in ingredients. It also used data from 2009 through 2011 to estimate environmental impacts; more recent data could result in better estimates. In addition, future research could incorporate data on the actual energy density of different animal-sourced ingredients, instead of averaging across ingredients as was done for this study. The author adds: “This study shows environmental benefits when vegan diets are used to feed not just people, but dogs and cats as well. However, to safeguard health, it’s important that people feed only vegan pet food labeled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards.” Newswise gives journalists access to the latest news and provides a platform for universities, institutions, and journalists to spread breaking news to their audience.

2023-10-04	18:45:41+00:00	News Department	Satirical “Dog Meat” Brand Sparks Controversy Among Cornellians at Monday Event	https://cornellsun.com/2023/10/04/satirical-dog-meat-brand-sparks-controversy-among-cornellians-at-monday-event/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=satirical-dog-meat-brand-sparks-controversy-among-cornellians-at-monday-event	At a pop-up event on Ho Plaza on Oct. 2, satirical brand Elwood's Organic Dog Meat stressed their believed hypocrisy of meat-eating to students passing by. Elwood’s Organic Dog Meat, a satirical brand created by vegan Molly Elwood to spread awareness about veganism, arrived on campus on Monday Oct. 2 — where they stressed their believed hypocrisy of meat-eating and virtues of veganism to students passing by the entrance of Willard Straight Hall. Elwood’s does not sell dog meat nor other products of any kind. The satirical brand made it a point to challenge many students’ views on veganism and the consumption of animals by using dog meat, a sensitive topic, as a vocal point for discussion on these topics. Monday’s event was sponsored by Allied Scholars for Animal Protection, an organization that aims to produce student activists for animal protection. “I like to take the joke as far as I possibly can,” said Natalie Fulton — a YouTuber and animal rights activist who participated in the event — in an interview with The Sun. “Because one thing we’ve realized is that people don’t change unless they’re a little uncomfortable.” The Frequently Asked Questions page on Elwood’s website states its concept is not meant to evoke or be connected with a specific country — despite the consumption of dog meat being a documented pejorative stereotype for East and Southeast Asians, particularly for Chinese and Koreans. The brand claims that the goal is to correct what they believe to be hypocritical actions by those who justify eating animals but still believe in animal rights. “The only reason we are doing dog [meat] is because most people on average care about dogs. I have a dog, [and] I would never eat a dog even if it’s humanely raised and humanely killed and all that,” said Faraz Harsini, founder and CEO of ASAP, in an interview with The Sun. “So the whole point is to get people’s attention and bring attention to eating other animals.” Fulton said the choice of dog meat was to highlight the difference in perception between animals such as dogs and cats — which are primarily kept as companions — and other domesticated animals, typically kept as tools. “Society’s taught us that certain animals deserve respect and reverence such as dogs and cats but other animals are tools for us to use for resources and don’t even count,” Fulton said. “People are totally [in favor of] animal rights until they realize that they would have to change something about their lifestyle.” The comparison between dogs and other animals is a goal Elwood’s organic dog meat seeks to emphasize. They believe all animals have a right to life without having to suffer or be eaten. “I think a lot of the reason [for] using dogs … is [to grab] people’s attention,” said Jessica Cohen ’25, the president of Cornell’s chapter of ASAP. “By showing that a dog is not really any different than a cow, and a pig and other animals we eat, it’s helping people realize how their food choices impact all these animals who go through pain and suffering every day.” Cohen and Cornell’s chapter of ASAP aim to make vegan food options more accessible and affordable on campus. “We are working hard on some initiatives in the dining hall,” Cohen said. “We are trying to get more plant-based options.” Elwood’s presence caused mixed reactions from students, however, with many questioning the organizers’ motives and the views they represented prior to the event. “I had heard of the event beforehand and then I saw some posts on social media about this event being racist,” Ryan Noonan ’25 said. “Why are people saying it’s racist? I wanted to come and see what I thought about it.” Although Elwood’s strategy drew many students to the event, some students found it to be ineffective in convincing students of the brand’s mission. “I personally think it’s failed,” Noonan said. “If you look at the backlash, it doesn’t really matter how good your arguments are if people aren’t receptive to them.” However, not all reactions to the event were negative. “I just decided to stop by because it seemed really interesting,” said Owen Luo ’27. “I thought [the event] really stood out to me and kind of changed my perspective, because I would never eat a dog. But then on the other hand, I am going to eat all these other animals, and it’s like cognitive dissonance.” Anthony Nagle ’27 is a Sun contributor. He can be reached at [email protected].

The alleged cryptocurrency fraudster, 31, was in Manhattan court Tuesday to face a jury for the first time, where he stands accused of embezzling funds from FTX customers and funneling them to his hedge fund Alameda Research. He was seen in court sketches beginning his trial without his famously long locks, and he wore a slim-fitting suit with a yellow tie as jury selection began. Bankman-Fried's preparations for trial were upended, his lawyers claim, after his record $250 million bail bond was revoked on August 11, as they alleged he has been forced to subsist only on bread, water and peanut butter. In court sketches, the results of his strict vegan diet - which his lawyers claimed led him not to receive enough food behind bars - could be seen Bankman-Fried, 31, stands accused of embezzling funds from FTX customers and funneling them to his hedge fund Alameda Research After the former billionaire was sent behind bars to await trial on August 11 (pictured in court that day), his lawyers claimed he was fed a 'flesh diet' and forced to subsist on bread, water and peanut butter :: Do you have a negative opinion about cryptocurrency? :: If a company involved in the cryptocurrency industry or the financial industry fails, do you feel that only the owners of the company must be to blame? :: Do you have any negative opinion about amassing wealth to support causes to improve the world or help others? :: The defendant in this case has ADHD, which might affect things like his physical behavior, body language, or eye contact. Please raise your hand if you have never had any personal or professional experience with ADHD. Do you have any opinion about the fact that the defendant has ADHD? Ahead of his trial, which could see him sentenced to up to 115 years in prison, Bankman-Fried trimmed his unkempt hairstyle which became a key part of his image before FTX collapsed. It is unclear where Bankman-Fried got the haircut but inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is being held, are given access to a barber. At the same time they complained about his prison diet, Bankman-Fried's legal team also alleged that his trial preparations were hampered by a lack of access to computers or his medication. He was previously granted access to Adderall, after his lawyers told the court that he would take 10mg tablets three to four times a day for his ADHD. By the end of the court's proceedings Tuesday, jury selection was nearly finished, paving the way for opening statements to begin Wednesday morning once the final 18 members of the panel were chosen. Both the prosecution and defense said they would need around half an hour each to open the case. During jury selection one prospective juror said they did not think they could serve because their twin brother lost so much to cryptocurrency it ‘almost ruined him’. One woman said she didn’t understand crypto currency, sparking Judge Lewis Kaplan to tell her she wasn’t alone. Another woman said she had concerns about her impartiality because a friend of hers hanged himself after getting caught up in a Ponzi scheme. Judge Kaplan told the prospective jurors to arrive half an hour early on Wednesday due to the ‘festivities’ taking place at the New York Supreme Court next door, where Donald Trump’s fraud trial is taking place. The 31-year-old saw his record $250 million bail bond revoked in August after repeatedly angering prosecutors and breaching his conditions, including using a VPN to stream the Super Bowl while banned from the internet The former financial wunderkind has seen a catastrophic fall from grace after launching his cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019, which grew into a platform worth tens of billions of dollars within years. He lived lavishly and made a series of extravagant purchases - including lucrative political donations - while recruiting A-list celebrities such as Tom Brady and Larry David to promote his status. But when the company suffered a disastrous collapse in November 2022, his customers were left without around $10 billion, prosecutors claim. His alleged $8 billion scheme has been branded 'one of the biggest financial frauds in American history', and the trial is anticipated by some to produce fireworks as Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend and former top lieutenant, Caroline Ellison, 29, is expected to be the prosecution's star witness. Ellison, who ran Alameda Research, may see her credibility challenged by Bankman-Fried's defense as she could take the stand alongside former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. Wang was FTX's chief technology officer, and once ranked as the 227th richest person in America before the platform collapsed. He pleaded guilty in December to wire fraud and three conspiracy counts of wire and securities fraud. Singh was the director of engineering at FTX, and pleaded guilty in February to charges of wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance misdeeds Bankman-Fried's attorneys have signaled credibility may be a key part of their case, potentially arguing those testifying against him are motivated to implicate their client to get a lower sentence for themselves, a common strategy in white collar fraud cases. A bombshell trial is expected to feature his ex-girlfriend and former top lieutenant, Caroline Ellison, 29, as the prosecution's star witness Also potentially testifying against Bankman-Fried is former FTX executives Gary Wang (left) and Nishad Singh (right). Wang was FTX's chief technology officer, and once ranked as the 227th richest person in America before the platform collapsed. Singh was the director of engineering at FTX, and pleaded guilty in February to charges of wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance misdeeds Bankman-Fried, pictured sleeping on a beanbag, had an almost god-like reputation within the crypto industry, but prosecutors allege it was built on lies The case has been likened to the trial of Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, who was jailed for 11 years for defrauding investors in her medical company out of $945 million The case has been likened to the trial of Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, who was jailed for 11 years for defrauding investors in her medical company out of $945 million. Potential jurors in Bankman-Fried's case are expected to be asked whether they have a negative view of crytpocurrency, and whether they have any experience with ADHD, a condition Bankman-Fried has. Like Holmes' case, it is likely to include reams of complicated financial evidence. It will also delve into the complex technology behind cryptocurrency and trading, in a similar vein to the inclusion of complicated scientific evidence in Holmes' trial. Bankman-Fried's is the highest profile case U.S. prosecutors have so far brought against a former cryptocurrency executive. His indictment last December marked a spectacular fall from grace for Bankman-Fried, who had garnered a reputation as a legitimate operator in an industry whose image was pockmarked by scams and purported get-rich-quick schemes. Prosecutors say Bankman-Fried built that reputation on lies and bolstered it with endorsements from celebrities and star athletes. Bankman-Fried has been detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since Aug. 11, after the judge found he had likely engaged in witness tampering - including by sharing Ellison's personal writings with a reporter. He will be brought to court early on most days to allow him to prepare with his lawyers. The comments below have not been moderated.

2023-10-03	08:26:27+00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amelia-tait	‘I can’t kill a wolf but will happily watch a Sim drown’: murder and morality in video games	https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/oct/03/murder-morality-video-games-harvest-little-sister-kill-zelda-ethics	From being unable to harvest ‘little sister’ characters but happy to kill others freely, to playing the Legend of Zelda as a vegan – gaming ethics are complex and highly personal I can kill foxes but I can’t kill wolves. Not in real life, obviously – in real life I send emails eight hours a day – but in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, where every animal is an arrow away from becoming a fortifying meal. Shoot a wolf and you’ll be rewarded with a thick red slab of raw prime meat, but I can’t do it, I just can’t do it, even though they often attack me in packs. They look too much like dogs. I can kill a fox – even though they never attack me, and they often let out sad little yelps – but many other gamers can’t. One post in the Tears of the Kingdom subreddit is entitled, “I can’t shoot the foxes” and has almost 500 upvotes. “They’re so sweet and nice I can’t bring myself to hurt them,” the original poster wrote. None of this, naturally, makes a lick of sense. Foxes, wolves, whatever – every animal in Tears of the Kingdom is made entirely of code. Morally and materially, there is no difference between shooting a wolf and clubbing an enemy to death with a boulder attached to a stick (in the game, I repeat, in the game). Yet somehow, many of us find one of these actions emotionally easier than the other. Why exactly is this, and what other ethical limitations do gamers set for themselves? Twenty years ago, a software engineer who we shall call Tom (he asked not to be identified) decided to return the Nintendo strategy game Pikmin to where he bought it. The game’s eponymous creatures are tiny half-plant, half-animals who make suitably adorable squeaks; as the protagonist, you round them up and use them in combat. Though it is entirely possible to complete the game without sacrificing a single Pikmin, the mites are clearly intended to be expendable – something that troubled Tom. “It was very frustrating and saddening,” he says. Tom, who is now 42 years old and lives in Alabama, felt sorrow and disgust when he reached the game’s first boss and realised he would have to sacrifice his newfound friends. So he conscientiously objected and returned the game. Despite this, he can play games where he needs to kill people in self-defence, or where the actions of the protagonist are explicitly presented as immoral. “Pikmin definitely crossed a line for me that other games didn’t,” he says “This was not just killing in defence … It was throwing away the lives of those I’d recruited for my own purpose.” Is all of this as simple as not wanting to “kill” things that are cute or harmless? Some people don’t shoot the horses in Red Dead Redemption and animal rights organisation Peta once condemned catching bugs in Animal Crossing. Yet our gaming ethics are often highly personal. “When playing PowerWash Simulator I refused to spend any of the in-game currency I earned on buying the various upgrades,” says Will Cooling, a 37-year-old diversity manager from the West Midlands. As a boy, Cooling used to help hose down the fridges and workstations at his dad’s butchers – the game reminded him of this, so Cooling sought to play authentically. “It wasn’t like my dad would let me buy new tools if I encountered a bad stain!” he says. Cooling’s refusal to invest in upgrades meant each level took much longer to complete than necessary, but eventually the game forced him to forgo his principles to continue playing. “That broke my immersion,” he says, disappointed that the game refused to reward what he calls, “the digital equivalent of elbow grease”. Abby Marks, a 21-year-old student from Florida, has to pick up litter when she plays survival game The Long Dark. “I spent a lot of time as a kid running around in the woods and seeing the trash that got left all around really bothered me, and I always felt some responsibility to clean it up,” she says. This transferred over into playing the game. Nonetheless, Cooling and Marks can happily play violent games. At the same time that Cooling was playing PowerWash Simulator last summer, he was also enjoying first-person shooter Prodeus. “If I’m playing a more violent game, then that’s the persona I’m playing, and I play to the blood-curdling logic of that game,” he says. He also finds that violent games, “don’t give you as much time to brood on things like morality or purpose because the action is so frenetic”. Still, explicitly violent games can cross the line for some gamers. Seth Katz, a 42-year-old hospital vice-president in Kansas, finds himself unable to harvest the “little sister” characters in the underwater adventure, BioShock, even though doing so would help him upgrade faster in the game. “It just seems wrong,” he says, “It’s not something that happens off screen, but you have to watch your character do it and there are maybe a dozen of these characters in the game so you have to do it over and over and over again.” He is able to “murder” freely in other games, such as Call of Duty and Borderlands, because the enemies are “mindless” and “faceless” and his actions are justified as self-defence. Some games are designed to present gamers with ethical dilemmas – harvesting the little sisters in BioShock results in a “bad” ending, while Red Dead Redemption features morality meters that measure a player’s decisions. Yet many gamers feel ethically conflicted in games that don’t invite this scrutiny. Sarah Taylor, a 34-year-old PR director from Berkshire, played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a vegan in lockdown. “I decided not to kill any animals or eat any animal products in-game,” says Taylor, who went vegan in 2019 after trying out Veganuary. Although she says being vegan in the game started as a joke, she began to take pride in her actions (the secret to not eating virtual meat, she says, is stocking up on radishes and durians). “I was proud that my values carried over to the game. Even though I knew it would make no difference!” Charlotte, a 33-year-old film festival worker from Glasgow, has more specific Zelda rules. While she does eat meat in the game, she doesn’t kill foxes, crows, small birds or goats. She also avoids killing enemies when they’re wearing little backpacks full of fruit. “It feels like they’re kind of busy doing their gathering and not doing any harm. They have to survive in the world like I do,” she argues. “I also don’t attack them when they’re asleep or chatting with their friends round the campfire. There’s something kind of touching the way the interspecies bad guys all hang out together and have their own communities.” Academics have studied our moral choices in video games. In 2012, Baylor University, Texas, media lecturer Daniel Shafer found that players can either be “morally activated” or “morally disengaged” while gaming – the latter being likely to choose “evil” options when playing. The most common justification from this group was that, “it’s just a game”, while morally activated people had empathy for their in-game “victims”. Another study, published in 2010 by academics from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, found that gamers felt guiltier if they engaged in virtual violence that was “unjustified” in the story. Additionally, researchers wrote, “people felt guiltier when they shot video game characters whose private social background was known than when the character’s background was unknown”. Whether any of this affects our real world actions is a debate that’s been going on for decades. Some academics believe that harming animals in video games can contribute to moral indifference toward animals and to their routine mistreatment, while other experts have found that video games don’t lead to violent behaviour. The crossover between the real and the virtual is undoubtedly complex. Though many gamers bring their real world morals into games, things clearly vary from game to game and scenario to scenario. I can’t kill a wolf in Zelda, but I will happily remove the ladder from a Sim’s swimming pool and watch them drown. I can confidently say that I’m unlikely to perform either of these actions in the real world – although, thanks to Zelda, I am sometimes tempted to go into my neighbours’ houses and smash up all their pots.

The retailer opened its highly sought after Christmas delivery slots last week, and the usual frenzy around securing a slot has already begun .

A spokesperson for the retailer said: 'We always stagger the release of our festive slots and will begin rolling out this year's Christmas delivery slots from the end of September.

Have yet to receive any notification (and nothing on app) Really concerned will not get slot.' Last year, priority was given to 'Smart Pass' customers when it came to booking the highly desirable slots. Remaining options were offered to non-Smart Pass customers some few weeks later.

2023-10-02	15:09:05+00:00		The BMW i5 Is The Impossible Burger Of Electric Sedans	https://jalopnik.com/the-bmw-i5-is-the-impossible-burger-of-electric-sedans-1850891676	There’s a common trope in automotive writing – it’s common to bemoan the death of the ICE, and complain that EVs will never match the soul and spirit of gas-powered cars. Chuck in tacky, if not straight-up hackneyed metaphors comparing electric vehicles to vegan meals; a piece of fruit dressed to look like meat will never be as satisfying as a big juicy steak from some New York steakhouse most readers will ever go to. I mean, I guess, sure. It’s not wrong – gas-powered cars don’t act like EVs. A slice of watermelon grilled and doused in A1 steak sauce and Liquid Smoke is a terribly unsatisfactory approximation of a T-bone steak. It’s silly to assume that a piece of hot watermelon is representative of the entire universe of vegan and vegetarian cuisine. Personally, I think vegan and vegetarian meals are best when they embrace the essence of the ingredients they’re comprised of. Dishes like Palak Paneer and Falafel are god-tier meatless dishes that people seek out because they taste good. They stand on their own merits, they don’t need meat at all, nor does it seem like they’re emulating meat dish. But science has brought meat replacements a long way. There’s no need to play pretend with an acrid piece of slimy watermelon when you can easily get a pack of Impossible Burgers or Beyond Meat patties that taste 95% like ground beef. After driving two different variants of the new BMW i5 around southern Portugal, I’ve realized that the BMW i5 is less falafel and more Impossible Burger. It’s a 5-series that feels mostly normal, but under the skin, it’s metaphorically meatless and therefore better for you. I think that’s a good thing?(NOTE: BMW flew me from my house in Ohio, all the way to Lisbon, Portugal, to test out the i5 which included me confronting my fear of heights by crossing the 486-foot-high Vasco Da Gama bridge.) The BMW i5 is a really important car for the German brand, especially in the US. To my surprise, the 5-series isn’t actually as popular in Europe as one would think – the brand says that its most important markets are the US, South Korea, and China, in that order. It’s also going for volume, which may explain the i5’s lack of boundary-pushing in terms of styling. As the world’s car market becomes increasingly electrified, some automakers seem to have cold feet. Yes, they all talk a big game, but when it comes to producing, electrifying and selling models that sell in big volumes, and not just weird niches of expensive/ugly cars, many are behind. The cough-drop-shaped Mercedes EQE and EQS are offered in parallel to the standard E and S class. If you’re unsure of EV power or don’t like the styling of those two cars, Mercedes-Benz will happily sell you a traditionally styled E or S class sedan. Has it paid off? Eh, it’s not clear, EQ sales are up, but I’d imagine the unconventional styling is a hindrance. Mercedes-Benz has admitted it will soon discontinue these models for more traditionally styled, electrified versions of the C, E, and S class. BMW has beaten Mercedes to this conclusion. Like the i7 and 7-series, the i5 and ICE-powered 5-series look identical. In theory, the normal styling should get more butts into seats, as now they’ll just have to figure out if they can work with an electric vehicle, rather than trying to stomach a car that is very different from its gas-powered equivalent. BMW is aiming for 30% of all 5-series sold worldwide to be the electric i5. If we focus solely on the European market, that number increases to 50%. As far as styling, the i5 is the nicest recent BMW by a landslide. The iX is ugly, and I’ve been vocal about how little I like the i7 and 7-series – that car has a busy front fascia that distracts from the fact its profile and proportions are boring. However, the i5 is genuinely pleasurable to look upon. The side surfacing is refreshingly clean, nothing on the side of the i5 looks overly fussy or overwrought. The car’s proportions are strong, it’s a hair more cab-rearward than the 5-series of yore, but it’s not done so in a way that makes the i5 look like a practically-compromised cartoon drawing. It’s a nice-looking car, it looks either sporty or expensive depending on whether it’s in M guise or luxury trim. The interior is cool, too. It’s not quite as grandiose as the ultra-luxury aspiring i7, but it takes a lot of the good points and applies them in a smaller package. Like the i7, and recently released X1, the i5’s interior feels almost architectural in essence. The interior is filled with lines, angles, and rectilinear forms that are subtly more complicated than they appear at first glance. For example, the main 12.3-inch and 14.9-inch tandem-mounted gauge cluster and infotainment screen may just look like any ol’ screen setup common to nearly every other modern car, but it’s actually a curved display with one of the smallest bezels in the business. A color-changing, geometric crystalline trim that separates the top of the dash from the bottom adds a bit of ambiance to a well-made (if a little pretentious) interior design. BMW is choosing to lead with the i5 instead of the ICE variants of the 5-series, which may fool you into thinking it is a ground-up EV platform. It’s not. Like the i7, the i5 also uses a new variant of the CLAR (Cluster Architecture) platform it used on the outgoing model, re-engineered to accommodate battery electric powertrains seamlessly. It works – like the i7, the i5 makes few ergonomic compromises to accommodate the EV powertrain. Legroom and trunk size are generally identical between the cars. The i5 doesn’t have a weirdly high floor like many cars that are available in both gas and EV form, say, the Genesis G80. Unfortunately, the i5 doesn’t have a frunk, despite having such a long hood. BMW’s penchant for using the same engines and transmissions mostly interchangeably between way different applications in its lineup is alive and well in the electric era. BMW allowed us to drive the single-motor i5 eDrive40, and the dual-motor, M-Performance i5 xDrive M60. The eDrive40 has a similar rear-mounted, 335 horsepower motor, albeit with 295 Ft-Lbs of torque compared to the i4 eDrive40’s 317 ft-lbs. The top-level i5 M60 xDrive uses the same 335 horsepower rear motor but adds a 257 horsepower front motor for a total output of 593 horsepower, and 605 ft-lbs of torque when the boost paddle is pulled. It can be hard to make sense of horsepower numbers these days. When some EV competitors are advertising four-digit horsepower numbers, and motors on each wheel, a measly 335 horsepower from one single motor can seem uncompetitive. But, it isn’t. 335 horsepower is a lot of power, actually. Both the eDrive40 and M60 xDrive are sufficiently swift cars; the eDrive 40 in particular is the most impressive. If you aren’t looking for all-wheel-drive traction (or dual motor power), its single motor and respectable 0-60 time of 5.7 seconds is likely more than any BMW driver would ever need. Impressive, but performance numbers are only part of the picture here. BMW also hired composer Hans Zimmer to create a set of sounds that engender emotion while driving BMW’s EVs. BMW calls it “IconicSounds,” but in layman’s terms, it’s just simulated engine noise. Now, in sport mode, the sounds are a little over-the-top, but the real story is how it behaves in the BMW’s normal modes. Under constant cruising, or light to moderate acceleration, the i5 has a mild throaty buzz that stays proportional to both pedal position and road speed. It’s pleasant, but also very ignorable – the sound feels comfortably like a background element, and not like it’ll overtake a conversation or drown out the stereo. It feels familiar, but not gimmicky or annoying. Importantly, with the sounds enabled, the i5 feels like any other gas car on the market. I’d wager that most drivers wouldn’t even notice that the i5 is electric. Is that a good thing? I don’t know – I personally enjoy EVs that embrace their ultra quiet EV nature and eschew fake engine sounds altogether. But if you’re gonna do it, then do it right. The i5 does it right. Like the i7, the i5 isn’t the lightest vehicle on the road. The low-mounted, heavy battery does wonders for ride comfort, but that excess weight isn’t ideal for driver engagement. However, the i5’s shorter wheelbase, overall smaller dimensions, and suspension and chassis tuning make the i5 feel remarkably engaging. Unlike the i7 M70, where I assert that its additional M-credentials don’t add much aside from power, the M50’s sharper suspension and steering do credibly feel more engaging than the standard model. But, that doesn’t mean the i5 is perfect, though. The i5’s brakes are inconsistent, sometimes they feel great, but other times (especially during hard driving), the changeover from regenerative to friction braking can be abrupt and and feel unrefined. There’s no true one-pedal driving, either. Note: BMW reached out to clarify that “In fact, if you pull the shift toggle back a second time after you’ve engaged Drive, you’ll engage “B” or “brake” mode, which brings up maximum regen and one-pedal driving. If you also engage Auto Hold, you can drive for weeks without ever touching the brake pedal. This feature is present in all of our BEVs.” Although I am generally indifferent to frunks, it is disappointing that the i5 does not have one. BMW i5 program lead admitted that there’s nothing but an empty cavity underneath the hood, particularly in single-motor form, and yet there’s no way to access or use that space. Finally, the EV range is merely okay. It’ll do about 295 miles in eDrive40 form, and 256 in the M60 xDrive – both from an 81.2 kWh (usable) battery. The base i5 eDrive40 starts at $67,795, a steal compared to its closest competitors, the Genesis G80 Electrified, and Mercedes Benz EQE 350+. The i5 has more power than the base EQE, and its low price tag embarrasses the Mercedes Benz and Genesis’s respective roughly $75,000 and $80,000 pricetags. Yet, whereas the G80 comes standard with AWD, or the EQE can be optioned with AWD, buyers are forced to step up to the i5 M60 to get all-weather traction. At $85,095, the i5 M60’s level of luxury and performance is still a bargain compared to AMG versions of the EQE which reach into the six-figure range. Most importantly, a base i5 is about $9,000 more expensive than a base gas-powered 530i. Expensive, but priced close enough that a traditional gas car buyer could be swayed to make the jump to electric. In short, the i5 feels a lot like the 5-series we’ve always known, it just so happens to be electric. It’s a lot like the first time I took a bite of an impossible burger – I came in expecting to hate the thing, thinking it’d be a poor emulation of a well-loved favorite. Instead, I found a shockingly convincing meat replacement that was generally pretty yummy. It wasn’t perfect, but I’d definitely eat it again. The BMW i5 might be the vehicle to turn the brand’s EVs from niche player to volume seller.

2023-10-01	09:32:03+00:00	John James	Bosses say Covid has made Generation Z employees 'entitled' and workshy - as major firms are reduced to offering free vegan meals and fish and chips to lure staff back to the office	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12549753/Bosses-say-Covid-Generation-Z-employees-entitled-workshy-major-firms-reduced-offering-free-vegan-meals-fish-chips-lure-staff-office.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490	 Published: 10:29 BST, 1 October 2023 | Updated: 10:19 BST, 4 October 2023 Britain's businesses and workplaces are battling to make their 'entitled' 'Generation Covid' employees return to the office with many young workers now 'viewing work as an inherent negative', frustrated bosses have said. Due to the pandemic and rise of hybrid working systems, employers say that their workforce 'lacks the cohesion' it did pre-2020 - with sick days at an all-time high. To counter the climate of dissociation, workers are even being offered 'perks' like lunchtime meals and networking opportunities to coax them back to their desks. Big Four accounting firm KPMG - which employs 14,000 people in the UK - said it gave the freebie to workers including offers of vegan meals and the British staple 'fish and chip Fridays' - but despite this office based work is still on the decline. NHS data shows that one in five 17 to 24-year-olds reported a mental health condition in 2022 and that 635,000 Britons are not currently working due to nerves, anxiety or depression. Big businesses including Zoom and HSBC have now been forced into making moves to drag their employees back to the office - including newly-hired Generation Zers who may have spent all of their short working lives dialling in from home. Generation Z, which usually refers to people born between the middle to late 1990s and the early 2010s, saw the end of their school days and university careers blighted by lockdowns and experts fear that may have hindered their professional social skills. Business leaders say the attitude of new workers sits at odds with the traditional norms of office based workplace culture and is indicative of Generation Z's warped mentality as to what is expected of them at work. Speaking to MailOnline, Liz Villani, founder of BeYourselfAtWork said: 'Since the pandemic, the power balance between workers and businesses has shifted in favour of the workers, compounding a trend we saw even before the pandemic whereby people are increasingly viewing work as an inherent negative. 'After having time spent working from home during the pandemic, workers feel entitled to it and think they 'can do just as much at home as in the office'. 'There's an air of entitlement in the workforce at the moment and workers think about themselves without seeing the big picture. 'Workplace friendships are less common than before, productivity is lower and as we've seen reported this week, sickness leave is at an all time high. 'These are all symptoms of a culture that views work as a negative thing, rather than an opportunity to find purpose and fulfilment. 'We need to reverse these trends to help our businesses grow, for teams to become more closely tied, and more importantly so that people can strive to enjoy what they do for most of their waking hours.' Indeed earlier this month, Channel 4's chief executive Alex Mahon said that returning to work with Britain's newest generation of recruits had led her to believe the generation as a whole lacked the 'skills to debate, disagree and work alongside people with different opinions.' A recent poll found that a staggering 37% of Generation Z preferred working with AI to actual people - leading 62% of surveyed managers to claim the new generation were 'destroying team culture.' A study by Robert Walter suggested that Gen Z'ers entering the workplace work better with devices than people - or as associate director Janine Blacksley surmised: 'many Gen Zer's have entered the workplace remotely or in a hybrid manner so social skills have taken a hit.' After years of home working large scale employers are now demanding their workers return to the offices for productivity as much as anything else - but their has been pushback. In August, the banking giant HSBC ordered its 18,500 UK workers back to their desks for three days a week. Trade union Accord, which represents Lloyds Bank staff, expressed dismay when, in April, it told staff to spend at least two days in the office with staff expressing 'shock, disappointment and anger at what they see as unnecessary disruption to their lives'. UK employees spend an average of 1.5 days a week logged in from the study, the dining table or the patio – compared to an international average of 0.9 days Other business leaders have argued that by granting these eager upstarts this unearned autonomy they are ensuring they will never actually properly fit into the workplace and perform as desired. Speaking at the Royal Television Society's Cambridge Convention, Channel 4's chief executive Alex Mahon argued that today's new recruits were spoilt. She said 'particularly post-pandemic' Gen Z youngsters 'haven't got the skills to discuss' and 'haven't got the skills to disagree'. She said this phenomenon, which was being seen in the workplace, was a 'dangerous step change'. The Channel 4 boss cited the time youngsters had spent 'being out of colleges' during the pandemic, meaning they had not been exposed as much to 'people with a difference of opinion'. Ms Mahon told the Royal Television Society Cambridge Convention: 'What we are seeing with young people who come into the workplace - particularly post pandemic - with this concentration of short form content [short videos on services like Tik Tok and YouTube] is they haven't got the skills to debate things. 'They haven't got the skills to discuss, they haven't got the skills to disagree and commit because they haven't been raised, particularly with being out of colleges to have those kind of debates, to get to the point where you've got people with a difference of opinion to you and you're happy to work alongside that, and that is a really dangerous step change in my view that we are seeing.' Not everyone is so pessimistic about the challenges of reincorporation however. Hayley Grange is the founder of hiring firm Twenty2 Recruitment & Consultancy and told MailOnline the notion that all Gen Z'ers want to idle at home is untrue. She said: 'I think it is a misconception that Gen Z dislikes being in the office. Our marketing assistant joined us shortly after her graduation in 2021, having spent the last 2 years of her university degree in and out of lockdowns. We have noticed no impact of this on her ability to work in the office or work from home. 'However, she joined us as an apprentice, a different path to many graduates, due to the lack of movement in the job market towards the end of the pandemic lockdowns. 'At Twenty2, we operate on a hybrid working model which works well for the whole team, ages ranging from 20s to 40s. 'Gen Z are young people and just like the generations before them, they enjoy socialising and being part of a team.' Anecdotal evidence aside though it's clear more needs to and is being done to drag Brits back to the office. A study in July confirmed that Britain was the working from home capital of Europe in news that provoked fury among Tory MPs. UK employees spend an average of 1.5 days a week logged in from the study, the dining table or the patio – compared to an international average of 0.9 days. In response, it was revealed earlier this month that soon civil servants will face a 'working from home' crackdown. Downing Street is poised to issue new guidance to all Whitehall departments in a bid to end the culture of 'Tuesday to Thursday' working which has developed since the pandemic. The new push will be led by Paymaster General Jeremy Quin to tackle plummeting public sector productivity, it has been reported. Departments were on average half empty last month, according to official statistics. None had more than two-thirds of staff at their desks. A source close to Mr Quin said: 'This isn't some fishing expedition against the civil service – it's about delivering for the taxpayer. 'To be clear, we expect civil servants to be in the office wherever needed to drive delivery.' The source told The Daily Telegraph: 'The taxpayer forks out for government buildings and rightly expects them to be used. 'Equally, junior staff cannot be expected to learn from behind their desks at home.' Gillian McAteer, is a Director of Employment law at Citation Gillian McAteer, is a Director of Employment law at Citation. Speaking to MailOnline, she argued that employers could take small positive steps to address the differences in approach to modern working between their employees. She explained: 'Most workplaces are multigenerational, with employees who may fit into the categories of 'baby boomers', 'Generation X', 'Millennials' and 'Generation Z' . It can be challenging to achieve a harmonious working environment when each generation may have different aspirations, attitudes towards technology and preferences in communication. 'For example, a 'baby boomer' may prefer to communicate with colleagues and managers face to face or on the telephone, whereas someone from 'Gen Z' may prefer to communicate online. This could lead to conflict and disengagement in the workplace if careful planning isn't put in place to ensure that everyone's needs are catered for. 'Much has been talked about Gen Z’s preference for digital communication but at the heart of successful businesses is teamwork and having the interpersonal skills to work effectively in a team can be as important as technical skills. 'Employers should not assume everyone has the same skills in this area. Taking a lead by setting clear standards of behaviour, demonstrating this throughout the business and coaching employees who need extra support are key steps to creating a positive working environment . 'The metrics show that diversity makes businesses stronger and if employers are to reap the benefits of all Gen Z have to offer they need to ensure that those employees who may not be as resilient due to entering the workforce during the pandemic, are supported to integrate into the workplace where people may have differing views and opinions. The support offered should be tailored to the individual needs of the organisation and the individuals employed there. 'Businesses also need to appreciate that their managers are absolutely key in ensuring that Gen Z employees are encouraged to engage with colleagues from all generations who may have different views to them. 'However, this can be a very delicate balancing act and employers need to be mindful that if there is conflict in the workplace, it can be costly and time consuming to deal with any ensuing grievances and in more extreme cases, claims at employment tribunals.'

2023-09-30	21:17:09+00:00	By				Dominique Birouste, Kidspot	I’m raising my newborn vegan — it’s not as simple as you think	https://nypost.com/2023/09/30/im-raising-my-newborn-vegan-its-not-as-simple-as-you-think/	 Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. You may not know her name but reality TV star Lucy Watson is making waves across social media. The former Made in Chelsea star and her husband, James Dunmore, shared their excitement about expecting their first child. But what truly made headlines was Lucy’s revelation during a Q&A session with her followers: she’s planning to raise her baby as a vegan. The TV personality also revealed that she has been grilled by her followers over links between her fertility struggles and veganism. “I’ve had many people along this journey tell me you need to give up the vegan diet, it’s stopping you getting pregnant. That is not the case. There are people who are crack addicts and get pregnant, being vegan is not going to stop you,” she wrote. The 32-year-old’s journey into veganism began long before the baby bump came into the picture. Her deep-seated commitment to a plant-based lifestyle stemmed from a childhood memory where she witnessed a lamb being slaughtered on her family farm, an experience that reshaped her dietary choices forever. Since then, she’s championed the cause of animal welfare and plant-based living, and her passion led to the creation of two bestselling cookbooks catering to plant-based diets. As Lucy embarks on motherhood, she’s determined to instil the values she holds dear into her child’s upbringing. For her, veganism isn’t merely a dietary choice; it’s a promise to the animals and a commitment to a compassionate way of life. The decision to raise a child as a vegan sparks curiosity and debate. As a diet, veganism abstains from all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs, and relies heavily on plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Advocates argue that a well-balanced vegan diet can provide all the essential nutrients for a child’s healthy growth, including protein, calcium, and vitamins. It can also teach children about empathy for animals and sustainable living. However, like any dietary choice, there are considerations to keep in mind. A vegan diet may require careful planning to ensure that children receive adequate nutrients, such as vitamin B12, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, typically found in animal-derived foods. Parents raising vegan children must pay special attention to nutrition and may need to supplement their diets accordingly. Lucy’s decision to raise her baby as a vegan shines a spotlight on the broader conversation around plant-based parenting. It underscores the importance of informed choices, balanced nutrition, and a commitment to values that resonate with each family. While the vegan diet offers numerous potential benefits, it’s crucial for parents to educate themselves and consult with healthcare professionals to ensure their child’s well-being. In the end, Watson’s choice to raise her child as a vegan isn’t just about food; it’s about instilling a love for animals, the environment, and a compassionate way of life. Her journey inspires a new generation of parents who wish to raise their children with both a love for plant-based living and an awareness of the world around them.
2023-09-29	20:38:06+00:00		Chase Elliott Enters Danica Patrick’s Good Books With Massive Vegan Revelation	https://www.essentiallysports.com/nascar-news-chase-elliott-enters-danica-patricks-good-books-with-massive-vegan-revelation/	Danica Patrick achieved fame as the most successful woman in open-wheel racing, following her 2008 IndyCar victory. Despite retiring from the Cup Series in 2018, she remains a magnetic presence in the motorsports world, albeit not always for the right reasons. Recently, Patrick stirred controversy with her comments about the late former girlfriend of Martin Truex Jr, Sherry Pollex. Her remarks raised eyebrows and fueled the ongoing debate around Patrick’s outspoken nature. Furthermore, Patrick also found herself in the line of fire of passionate Formula 1 fans when she joined Sky Sports as a reporter during a past race weekend. However, it now seems that Danica Patrick, one of the sport’s most controversial figures, has found an unlikely ally in NASCAR’s poster boy, Chase Elliott. Danica Patrick’s vocal opposition to a fully vegan diet is no secret among her followers. In her 40s, Patrick has solidified her position as a notable influencer in the realm of dietary preferences, consistently sharing her candid opinions and personal experiences. In the past, her love for meat came to the forefront of conversations when she responded to a doctor’s post discussing muscle loss after the age of 30. While the doctor emphasized the importance of a protein-rich diet and resistance training, Danica added her own perspective with a straightforward “Eat meat. Lift weights.” Her stance, though aligned with her dietary choices, may raise eyebrows among some NASCAR fans who strictly adhere to veganism. However, this is not the first time she has made polarising statements. 4.8k readers Last 30 min October 08, 2023 04:29 am EDT October 08, 2023 10:05 am EDT October 08, 2023 01:13 am EDT October 06, 2023 11:26 am EDT October 09, 2023 01:49 am EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest NASCAR stories via Google! Click on Follow Us and Tap the Blue Star. During one such instance, she asserted that veganism accelerates the aging process, a perspective she arrived at after briefly attempting a vegan diet out of concern for animals but ultimately finding that a meat-inclusive diet made her feel significantly better. While Danica Patrick’s dietary opinions have stirred headlines, a recent revelation from Hendrick Motorsports’ star, Chase Elliott, appears to align with some of her perspectives. The moment unfolded as Hendrick Motorsports shared a teaser video addressing popular Google web searches about the 2020 NASCAR champion. One question posed was whether Elliott is vegan, to which he offered a resounding “I’m definitely not vegan.” This revelation aligns with his past statements when in a 2018 interview with NASCAR reporter Jeff Gluck, Elliott was faced with a hypothetical scenario: NASCAR offers the No. 1 pit stall to the first driver willing to go vegan for a month. His response was unwavering, as he firmly rejected the notion, “No, absolutely not. No. I’ll take my chances,” emphasizing his fondness for meat. His commitment to a non-vegan diet was underscored by his explanation of meat serving as his preferred fuel source in another interview with GQ. He detailed his pre-race meal, typically consisting of grilled chicken, before taking to the racetrack. “I’m pretty strict on a grilled chicken-type lunch with rice and corn.” Indeed, since that disastrous stint at Watkins Glen in the regular season, Chase Elliott seems to have found a winning formula, not just in his diet but also on the racetrack. In the midst of the NASCAR postseason, Chase Elliott’s name continues to resonate loudly, even though he’s not in the championship contention. Rick Hendrick‘s #9 team has had a far-from-stellar regular season, encountering misfortunes lap after lap. However, following the embarrassing limp to the pits due to a fuel shortage in the penultimate regular season race at Watkins Glen, the Georgia native has maintained an incredible streak. Ever since that fateful race, top-10 finishes have remained consistent for Elliott, except for a recent 11th-place finish in Texas. Enjoyed Your Read? Let us know how likely you are to recommend EssentiallySports to your friends! The spotlight now turns to Talladega, and the focus is on continuing the recent streak of success that Elliott has enjoyed. In the last seven races, he has secured top-10 finishes in five of them. Entering Talladega as the defending winner, having triumphed in the 2022 race at the same venue, Elliott says, “I don’t really think it’s any different. I do think everyone has gotten smarter just with the way we plate race now and manage a race.” He emphasizes that “smarter” doesn’t mean avoiding crashes altogether, as there will still be plenty of that action. Instead, it’s about strategic race management and survival. “Ultimately, you can just hope that you get through all of that and try to salvage a good points day. If you have a shot to win, try to grab the win. But, ultimately, I think, it’s just trying to survive the day.” As the playoffs unfolded, could Elliott secure a trip to victory lane this season, proving that even from the sidelines, he could be a force to be reckoned with? Only time will tell.

Yes, our mouths are watering too at the possibility of having a new favourite tub to reach for on the supermarket run. What’s more, the Ben & Jerry’s ‘Flavour Gurus’ have given us the ultimate scoop – telling us that the new flavour makes the perfect Affogato (an Italian dessert, where hot coffee is poured over ice cream). So what’s the new option we hear you ask? Caramel Café is the brand new tub on offer. It’s a caramel coffee non-dairy ice cream with caramel biscuit pieces and a marshmallow swirl – all topped with a creamy whipped topping, caramel sauce, and chocolate chunks. You can pick it up for just £5.50 in stores when you pluck up the courage for your next food shop. If you feel like treating yourself to an Affogato then simply pour a rich, velvety espresso over a scoop (or five) of Caramel Café and indulge. But, if you want proper measurements then douse 120g of ice cream with 2oz of hot espresso. And voila. Now, you might be thinking ‘can vegan ice cream really taste that good?’ – after all, you’re missing a pretty key component. But Metro.co.uk previously put the Ben & Jerry’s vegan range to the test, and the verdict? Pretty tasty. Yvette Caster says: ‘Ben & Jerry’s have done marvellous things with texture. The surprising thing with all flavours is that they’re made with almond milk and coconut. Honestly, I couldn’t taste a drop of either.’ So what are you waiting for? Try it for yourself.

The 32-year-old shared the news she was pregnant with her first child with husband of two years James Dunmore, 34, last week. Lucy has called the unborn child a miracle baby after admitting she and her fellow reality star partner had trouble conceiving. Some were quick to accuse her vegan diet of causing problems for her fertility, which Lucy dismissed in a series of Instagram stories. In an update, the media personality confirmed that she planned to raise her newborn as a vegan too. Lucy also reassured fans she would be sticking to her vegan diet, with some baby conscious alterations, throughout the pregnancy. In a Q&A, a fan wrote: ‘How is like being vegan and pregnant? Will you raise your baby vegan?’ This prompted Lucy, who opened her own vegan restaurant, to address the bubbling questions about her plant-based lifestyle. ‘For me veganism is a promise I made to the animals, one I will never break, no matter what,’ she explained. Lucy shared she was eating less processed foods and more whole foods, also adding more protein into her diet to make sure her body can handle the pregnancy. She added: ‘Very achievable to get everything you need on a vegan diet, you just need to make a conscious effort, such as with any diet, to meet all nutritional needs.’ According to the reality tv star, people had been telling her to stop being vegan as it was ‘stopping’ her from getting pregnant. There is no conclusive link that a vegan diet can impact fertility, although certain vitamins like B12 which is found in meat are connected to pregnancy. If a vegan follows a healthy diet and takes supplements, their diet is likely to be well rounded and not change their ability to have children. As Lucy said: ‘There are people who are crack addicts and get pregnant, being vegan is not going to stop you.’ Rounding off her post, she concluded: ‘And yes, our baby will be vegan.’ Lucy may struggle should her newborn need formula as there are very few infant formulas that are vegan as most are based off cow’s milk and even soya versions can contain minerals extracted from animals. That being said, provided the baby’s diet has all the nutrients they need there is no reason a vegan or vegetarian diet cannot be followed. Metro has reached out to Lucy’s representatives for comment. Got a story?

2023-09-29	11:36:30+00:00		Area guide to Fulham: why pizza and two Premier League teams means ‘west is best’ for Bosh! chef Ian Theasby	https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/area-guide-fulham-why-pizza-090000284.html	I have been in London for 12 years and in Fulham for the past three. I’ve done the compass — I was in Shepherd’s Bush first, then Highbury, Mile End, Clapham and now Fulham — but this is where I see myself living for the future. Fulham has a lot of character and obvious history. The architecture is very stimulating as you can see the history of London just walking down the road. It’s also greener than other areas. Where I’m from in Sheffield has big, green spaces and Fulham feels similar. Most of the borough is a cross section of people so you get the extremely well-to-do and the less well off. It’s diverse; you walk down the street and hear non-British voices and feel part of a global community. I’m a huge pizza fan but it’s difficult to do pizza well at home without a pizza oven. I love Rossopomodoro on Fulham Road and Pappa Ciccia; if you like pizza, those places are great. Eat Beirut on New Kings Road does a mean falafel wrap and amazing baba ganoush, and it’s naturally vegan so I can eat most of the things on the menu. In terms of drinking, I love The Duke On The Green, which won UK Pub Of The Year in 1971. You hear news stories about pubs closing but you go in here and it’s a hive of activity with a good atmosphere — plus it’s dog friendly. My tipple is a Guinness. I also like the Fulham Mitre, which is a bit off the beaten track. It has a decent kitchen, good vegan options and board games, which are great for a cosy, winter’s evening. The Virgin Active gym on Lillie Road is massive and has a pool. I also like the Gym House on Harwood Road as it has an icehouse, sauna and trainer called James, who knows absolutely everything about fitness. Bishops Park is well maintained and big enough to feel like you’re not in a city. I go for a run or a walk there, and my missus is pregnant so it’s a good place to get her out and walking around. It’s also nestled next to the Thames. I always imagine people in Victorian times in their big clothes taking a walk along the river here. There’s something beautiful about going into a fruit and veg shop, and Fulham Greens on New Kings Road is so colourful and fresh. Being a vegan in a vegetable shop is like being a kid in a sweet shop! Luigi’s Deli on Fulham Road is also a real gem; it’s been open for 50 years and the guys are very friendly. It’s proper Italian food and there’s a ridiculously good selection of Chianti. Also on Fulham Road is wine merchant Lea & Sandeman. You can get a very good quality bottle of wine there and the staff are extremely knowledgeable. My girlfriend Sarah and I go to the Picturehouse on Fulham Road as it has a good selection of movies. It’s an Art Deco building with lots of brass and is like something out of The Great Gatsby. I also like the Finborough Theatre, a small theatre of about 80, which is above a pub. I’ve been to see three shows there, two of which my girlfriend has produced. Where possible, I walk and get my steps up to 10,000 a day. Walking is good because you can listen to music or a podcast, or just think. Failing that, I do the Lime bikes if it’s raining and zip up to White City or our Bosh! offices on the Hammersmith roundabout. If I’m going to central London, nine times out of 10 I go on the Tube as there are three stations near me: Brompton Road, Baron’s Court and Fulham Broadway. Musgrave Crescent, overlooking Eel Brook Common. The houses there are old and spacious and have character. Plus, it’s just off King’s Road but very quiet and near Stamford Bridge. Two Premier League football teams in one area code: Fulham and Chelsea in SW6. Airplane noise is real. Having lived in the east, I really noticed it at first but after a while you get used to being on the flight path to Heathrow. West is best. And this is from someone who has lived on all points of the compass. Bosh! Meat, by Henry Firth and Ian Theasby (@bosh.tv), is available from HQ, HarperCollins now. St John’s Walham Green Church of England School, Holy Cross RC School and All Saints are all rated Good primary schools, while Lady Margaret School is an Outstanding secondary. Kensington Prep School GDST, Parsons Green Prep and Lycée Francais Charles de Gaulle are also local private school options.

The Made in Chelsea star, 32, made the claim during an Instagram Q&A with her fans this week. In response to a question about whether or not the reality TV star would raise her newborn on the same diet to which she adheres, Lucy wrote, 'yes, our baby will be vegan'. The revelation won't come as a shock to her followers as the reality television star has been a staunch supporter of animal rights and veganism her entire life. Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Lucy for comment. Lucy Watson, 32, (left) gave a glimpse into her parenting plans recently when she revealed she and husband James Dunmore, 34, (right) are raising their 'miracle' baby as a vegan It comes just days after Lucy shot down claims that being vegan added to her fertility issues and prevented her from getting pregnant. On Thursday she posted a Q&A in which she spoke about her 'painful' battle to conceive and how she received 'years of bad news' before falling pregnant. Following the initial questions, the animal rights activist was then asked: 'How is like being vegan and pregnant? Will you raise your baby vegan?' The author responded to this by revealing she had been grilled over links between her fertility and veganism. In response to a question about whether or not the reality TV star would raise her newborn on the same diet to which she adheres, Lucy wrote, 'yes, our baby will be vegan' She wrote: 'I've had many people along this journey tell me you need to give up the vegan diet, it's stopping you getting pregnant. 'That is not the case. There are people who are crack addicts and get pregnant. Being vegan is not going to stop you.' Earlier in the Q&A, fans asked about her baby journey, and she revealed she 'had struggles' over 'the past few years' and was faced with 'bad news after bad news'. In light of her career moves, which have seen Lucy pen two vegan cook books and open a plant-based restaurant, she was asked about her pregnancy diet. She penned: 'So many questions about veganism, whether I'm still vegan etc. For me veganism is a promise I made to the animals, one I will never break. no matter what.' Lucy and James, 34, married in a lavish ceremony in 2021 after meeting on Made in Chelsea. The pair revealed last Wednesday they are expecting their first child together.

2023-09-29	05:52:21+00:00	Lee Hall	Vegan Cats Do Not Exist	https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/09/29/vegan-cats-do-not-exist/	Cats may get health benefits from vegan diet, study suggests. So says a recent column by a science correspondent at the Guardian, describing new research comparing how cats fare when eating “vegan versus meat-based cat food.” In that research, published through PLOS One, authors Andrew Knight, Alexander Bauer, and Hazel Brown regularly refer to the respondents in their study as cats’ guardians. Not a legally accurate term, but the article speaks to its most interested readers—vegans—with the voice of allyship. I’m a 40-Year Vegan and a Cat Rescuer. And I Object. Veganism isn’t just about what’s on a plate. Veganism is an ideology of anti-domination. We can apply the vegan principle to our diets. Cats can’t. And then there’s the question of biological risk. Regardless of the disclaimer telling readers to check with their vets before changing their cats’ diets, this was a treacherous piece for the Guardian to run. Human veganism is not an eating disorder. Feline veganism might be, though—by proxy. Moreover, if proponents of feline veganism don’t stop pushing, their energies will lead to lab testing on institutionalized cats. For unless cats are kept in a controlled environment—as Knight et al. acknowledge in their article—comparative health indicators are questionable. Already, the stage has been set. “There is increasing interest among pet owners around alternative diets for pets,” a representative of the British Veterinary Association said, according to the Guardian. The Association’s current position holds that cats are obligate carnivores, and that supplements do not substitute for the nutrients they need. But now, the Association is “reviewing its advice.” Another troublesome factor with the “vegan cat” study is the significant number of respondents’ cats who meandered outdoors—although Knight downplayed it to the Guardian. As no cats were described as always indoors, we can assume some outsourcing from the local rodent, avian, and insect populations turned up in all these cats’ meals. The fate of voles, snails, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, and songbirds in harm’s way got no mention in the study—or by the science correspondent at the Guardian. Not only do cats chase other animals when roaming outside; their presence also imperils the planet’s few remaining wildcats—because intercourse with roaming housecats changes wildcat genetics. In short, there’s a lot in this research that should raise red flags. So, What’s a Vegan to Do About Cats? Ask those who launched veganism. Defining their mission in 1951, they expressly took humans to task for meddling in other animals’ evolutionary paths. This rules out the selective breeding of Felis silvestris lybica and any other animals for our purposes. The early vegans made a point of saying veganism is “not so much an effort to make the present relationship bearable” as to abolish humanity’s exploitation of animal life. Isn’t it bad enough that humans have made housecats out of wildcats? Don’t attempts to veganize them perpetuate the assault on their evolution, rather than challenge it? Moreover, charitable organizations have a responsibility to stick to their missions. In this case: * Let the wildcats live free and flourish if they can. Defend their habitat. * Call out pet breeding at any scale. We need not consider it too entrenched to challenge. It might be a multi-billion-dollar industry today, but in the 1800s, petkeeping was only an aristocrat’s hobby. Those are the vegan’s key mission-related messages. But today’s vegan messaging has veered off-course. The Vegan Society in Britain platforms Andrew Knight’s take. Knight’s new study itself got funding from ProVeg International, led by former Vegan Society CEO Jasmijn de Boo. Meanwhile, the American Vegan Society spotlights a US-based vegan vet and others who are feeding their “vegan cats.” It frustrates the bejeebers out of me to disagree with groups in which I hold membership, groups run by my co-workers in the movement. But I believe the best reading of veganism is always worth defending. Now more than ever, the world desperately needs veganism at its best. Everywhere, the planet’s animal life is in the throes of biodiversity and climate breakdown. Rather than try to make cats into vegans, we can all defend the lives and freedom of Earth’s untamed wildcats and bobcats, wolves and coyotes. Bring cats inside to support the indigenous animal life in our midst. Support local trap-neuter-return groups that do their best to care for, while phasing out, roaming cats. “In a vegan world the creatures would be reintegrated within the balance and sanity of nature,” says Veganism Defined. “A great and historic wrong, whose effect upon the course of evolution must have been stupendous, would be righted.” Some people say this principled challenge could ultimately lead to a society without “companion” animals. But why should we prop up the $320 billion pet products industry—a sector of the economy bent on distorting and exploiting the human urge to love and be loved? Can’t we rejoice in other animals’ presence on the planet without having and holding them? Wouldn’t that be the best way to model true empathy, and the psychological maturity that leadership in an ethics-based movement requires? In contrast, petkeeping is based on a cynically manipulative industry. Any article that fails to say this misses the essence of veganism. One Last Word, on Practicalities. If we take animals in, we must provide appropriate care rather than force them to scavenge. We should also question the custom of having pets, as it keeps us tethered to the very animal agribusinesses we aim to renounce. And for the animals’ own sake. In the United States, pets are surrendered by the millions annually to agencies and hundreds of thousands are “put down.” Even those who live in caring households have been forever cut off from the evolutionary path of their ancestors. The custom that confines them is part of that great and historic wrong… The call to imagine a society without pets may seem jarring now. It challenges us to transcend our need to be in charge of other beings. Impractically idealistic? Well, veganism never was the easy route. Social justice is elusive in human relations; but we strive for it. We need to strive, too, to be fair members of the community of life on Earth.

2023-09-28	13:31:30+00:00	Aidan Milan	Former vegan claims eating organ meat has helped her get her ‘life back’	https://metro.co.uk/2023/09/28/former-vegan-claims-eating-organ-meat-has-given-her-her-life-back-19570326/	A long-time vegetarian and sometime vegan who switched to eating fresh meat and organs has made some big claims, saying it’s helped her anxiety, depression and acne. Liz Seibert, a model and influencer from New York, first gave up meat when she was nine years old. Since she was in her early teens, Liz had suffered from acne, depression and anxiety. She also suffered from insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome and headaches. Liz felt like she’d tried everything she could to feel better, and it was suggested she take medication, but it wasn’t until she started eating organ meat that she says she started to get her ‘life back’. Now 23, she’s left vegetarianism and veganism behind under the advice of her nutritionist, who recommended she take organ meat supplements. She said: ‘I had been eating vegetarian or vegan my whole life thinking I was keeping myself healthy. ‘I felt like I had tried everything. Numerous different mental health medications, countless types of therapies, physical health medications, and even multiple different diets. ‘I think poor diet and lack of proper nutrition were a huge contributing factor to many of my health issues.’ These days, Liz consums organ and ‘high-quality meat’ every day. In the first month of doing so, she claims that her anxiety, depression, and stomach issues all improved, and within three months, her acne cleared up. She also says she stopped getting headaches and began sleeping better, and her period also returned after about four months. Interestingly, there are studies out there that suggest meat eaters may experience reduced instances of anxiety and depression compared to vegans. However, as this study by the University of Southern Indiana points out, it’s hard to conduct research on the topic without reporting bias from meat eaters creeping in. They say more robust studies are needed. There’s certainly not enough evidence to suggest that being a vegan or vegetarian is guaranteed to make you depressed or anxious. Some people swear that becoming vegan changed their lives for the better, while others very strongly feel the opposite. That being said, a balanced diet and getting regular exercise have long been associated with improving mental health. As the Mental Health Foundation puts it: ‘The relationship between our diet and our mental health is complex. However, research shows a link between what we eat and how we feel.’ The Mind website also points out that protein contains amino acids, which are your brain uses to make chemicals called neurotransmitters, which in turn help to ‘regulate your thoughts and feelings.’ So if you are going vegan or veggie, you’ll probably want to make sure you’re still getting amino acids from somewhere, such as: As for acne and meat consumption, a journal in JAMA Dermatology actually suggested high levels of meat consumption correlated with increased cases of adult acne. But again, different people have different experiences. The moral of the story? Speak to a registered doctor or dermatologist before taking medical advice from social media. While Liz thinks her diet is a major factor in how much better she’s feeling, that isn’t the only thing she changed – she’s also incorporated routine exercise, limbic and nervous system retraining, and daily laughter. Covid rules for 2023 explained – what if you test positive? The organs she eats the most are heart, brains with eggs, liver, and bone marrow. Liz said: ‘My whole entire life has changed. I feel alive again. I had been severely anxious and depressed my entire teenage/adult life. ‘This came with eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Not even therapy or medication helped very much or for very long. ‘My relationship with food is incredible. I don’t get headaches, pain, bloating, IBS, my periods are back – I lost them due to low weight – and painless.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Liz also takes organ supplements and eats other whole, unprocessed foods on top of her organ-heavy diet. She says it doesn’t come cheap, but it still costs less than what she spent as a vegetarian, and she’d also needed medications and doctor visits. Now, she buys her food from farms, which have organs on sale for cheaper than ‘normal’ meat. She can get a cow heart for about £16 ($20) and a packet of supplements for £41 ($50), both of which can last her almost a month if eaten alongside other meats and food. She said: ‘My old diet was expensive. I used to eat all of the fancy vegan baked goods, cereals, and almond milk. ‘My new diet is also expensive because I focus on really high-quality animal foods. However, now I don’t have to pay nearly as much for medications and doctors. ‘I’m learning to use food as medicine, and live in a way that supports my body, mind, and soul.’ Do you have a story to share?

2023-09-27	18:36:00+00:00		What we know about the company linked to the E.coli outbreak at Calgary daycares	https://globalnews.ca/news/9989427/what-we-know-company-linked-e-coli-outbreak-calgary-daycares/	Health officials say the source of an E. coli outbreak at several Calgary daycares, declared Sept. 4, was most likely meat loaf and vegan loaf served from a shared kitchen. More than 350 people have been infected and more than three dozen have been treated in hospital. Here’s what we know about Fueling Minds Inc., the company that runs the kitchen, which has been closed indefinitely. The Fueling Minds website says it’s a catering program for child-care centres and schools, offering nutritious breakfast, snacks and hot lunches. It has locations in Calgary and Saskatoon. The Fueling Brains Academy, which has the same corporate address and email as Kids U Centennial-Fueling Minds Inc., says on its website it has eight preschool and daycare locations in Calgary and nearby Strathmore. It takes care of about 2,000 children. Six of the 11 daycares initially closed due to the outbreak are Fueling Brains locations. Corporate records from the Alberta government show Fueling Brains Inc. was incorporated in the province in 2017. The company’s directors are Faisal Alimohd and Anil Karim, who are both listed as voting shareholders. Records show the Fueling Brains Academy trade name was registered as a child-care facility by Alimohd and was previously called Kids U Centennial Inc. The City of Calgary says it began investigating Fueling Minds after the outbreak. The company and its two directors face a total of 12 charges under municipal business bylaws and face a total fine of up to $120,000. The city alleges Fueling Minds operated without a city business licence that’s required when providing third-party food services to child-care centres not owned by the company. A proposed class-action lawsuit was filed Sept. 8 on behalf of those affected by the outbreak. It names as defendants Fueling Minds, Fueling Brains Academy and the company’s six daycares. Provincial and federal online records show some of the public funds awarded. Alberta records of grant payments show Kids U Inc. has received more than $490,000 since the beginning of 2021. Kids U Centennial Inc. received an additional $15,000. The federal government also has records of Kids U Inc. receiving $100,000 and Kids U Centennial Inc. receiving more than $200,000 in grants since 2021. Records show Alimohd was registered as a lobbyist in British Columbia until earlier this year. Kids U Inc. is also recorded in the federal lobby and a company representative made communications 38 times, including with Bardish Chagger, who was then the Liberal government leader in the House of Commons. Fueling Brains vice-president of strategic partnerships and growth is former Liberal member of Parliament Kent Hehr. Hehr’s profile on LinkedIn says he has been employed by Fueling Brains for almost three years. His mother, Judy Hehr, is listed as the company’s director of early learning and child-care services. Kent Hehr resigned from cabinet in 2018 following allegations of inappropriate behaviour and lost his seat in the 2019 election. “On behalf of the team at Fueling Brains, we are deeply saddened that children are sick. The health and safety of our children, parents and staff has always been our priority,” Faisal Alimohd said in a statement Sept. 5.
2023-09-27	01:56:36+00:00		Nine vegetables that are healthier for you when cooked	https://interaksyon.philstar.com/hobbies-interests/2023/09/27/219360/nine-vegetables-that-are-healthier-for-you-when-cooked/	Raw food diets are a fairly recent trend, including raw veganism. The belief being that the less processed food is, the better. However, not all food is more nutritious when eaten raw. Indeed, some vegetables are actually more nutritious when cooked. Here are nine of them. All living things are made up of cells, and in vegetables, important nutrients are sometimes trapped within these cell walls. When vegetables are cooked, the walls break down, releasing the nutrients that can then be absorbed more easily by the body. Cooking asparagus breaks down its cell walls, making vitamins A, B9, C and E more available to be absorbed. Mushrooms contain large amounts of the antioxidant ergothioneine, which is released during cooking. Antioxidants help break down “free radicals”, chemicals that can damage our cells, causing illness and ageing. Spinach is rich in nutrients, including iron, magnesium, calcium and zinc. However, these nutrients are more readily absorbed when the spinach is cooked. This is because spinach is packed with oxalic acid (a compound found in many plants) that blocks the absorption of iron and calcium. Heating spinach releases the bound calcium, making it more available for the body to absorb. Research suggests that steaming spinach maintains its levels of folate (B9), which may reduce the risk of certain cancers. Cooking, using any method, greatly increases the antioxidant lycopene in tomatoes. Lycopene has been associated with a lower risk of a range of chronic diseases including heart disease and cancer. This increased lycopene amount comes from the heat that helps to break down the thick cell walls, which contain several important nutrients. Although cooking tomatoes reduces their vitamin C content by 29%, their lycopene content increased by more than 50% within 30 minutes of cooking. Cooked carrots contain more beta-carotene than raw carrots, which is a substance called a carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A. This fat-soluble vitamin supports bone growth, vision and the immune system. Cooking carrots with the skins on more than doubles their antioxidant power. You should boil carrots whole before slicing as it stops these nutrients from escaping into the cooking water. Avoid frying carrots as this has been found to reduce the amount of carotenoid. Bell peppers are a great source of immune-system-boosting antioxidants, especially the carotenoids, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin and lutein. Heat breaks down the cell walls, making the carotenoids easier for your body to absorb. As with tomatoes, vitamin C is lost when peppers are boiled or steamed because the vitamin can leach out into the water. Try roasting them instead. Brassica, which include broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts, are high in glucosinolates (sulfur-containing phytochemicals), which the body can convert into a range of cancer-fighting compounds. For these glucosinolates to be converted into cancer-fighting compounds, an enzyme within these vegetables called myrosinase has to be active. Research has found that steaming these vegetables preserves both the vitamin C and myrosinase and, therefore, the cancer-fighting compounds you can get from them. Chopping broccoli and letting it sit for a minimum of 40 minutes before cooking also allows this myrosinase to activate. Similarly, sprouts, when cooked produce indole, a compound that may reduce the risk of cancer. Cooking sprouts also causes the glucosinolates to break down into compounds that are known to have cancer-fighting properties. Green beans have higher levels of antioxidants when they are baked, microwaved, griddled or even fried as opposed to boiled or pressure cooked. Kale is healthiest when lightly steamed as it deactivates enzymes that prevent the body from using the iodine it needs for the thyroid, which helps regulate your metabolism. For all vegetables, higher temperatures, longer cooking times and larger quantities of water cause more nutrients to be lost. Water-soluble vitamins (C and many of the B vitamins) are the most unstable nutrients when it comes to cooking because they leach out of vegetables into the cooking water. So avoid soaking them in water, use the least amount of water when cooking and use other cooking methods, such as steaming or roasting. Also, if you have cooking water left over, use it in soups or gravies as it holds all the leached nutrients. Laura Brown, Senior Lecturer in Nutrition, Food, and Health Sciences, Teesside University.

2023-09-26	19:00:04+00:00	By Leanne Battelle | ij.lbattelle@gmail.com | IJ correspondent	Tiburon has gotten sweeter with the opening of Jane/Marin	https://www.marinij.com/2023/09/26/tiburon-has-gotten-sweeter-with-the-opening-of-jane-marin/	Aside from adding a few gluten-free and vegan options to an extensive assortment of alluring cakes, pies, cookies, pastries and other confections, Sweet Things bakery in Tiburon has remained true to old-fashioned, all-American desserts for more than four decades. Owners Marsha Lasky and Sharon Leach have maintained a steadfast commitment to meticulously consistent, traditionally crafted temptations since they founded the business in 1977. Rather than considering shuttering their enduring legacy when they were contemplating retirement, they reached out to professional baker Amanda Michael, founder and owner of Jane (Michael’s daughter’s name), a bakery and café group in San Francisco with a similar approach to straightforward, classic baking. Last November, Michael not only took on Sweet Things in Tiburon (now called Jane/Marin), but also the location in San Francisco that Lasky and Leach opened in 1997 as well as an expansive wholesale component. “I always had an eye across the bridge (to Marin), but hadn’t been actively looking,” says Michael, who considers Lasky and Leach pioneers for women in business and expresses how impressed she’s always been with all that they’ve built. The Tiburon bakery remained opened until construction began in June and as Michael got acquainted with the staff, some of whom have been there for decades, she mindfully determined how best to combine the two businesses. The melded menu features some of the best of both — cakes, pies, tarts, cookies, bars, pastries and seasonal selections from Sweet Things and Jane’s artisan breads, croissants, kouign-amann, turnovers and cookies. All are made from scratch daily and shift seasonally. “It’s not a business that needed a big overhaul at all,” Michael says. “The (Sweet Things) classics are great. I love them and would never change that.” She adds that the layer cakes have been a go-to for her kids’ birthdays for years. The refrigerator case holds six fresh grab-and-go salads such as Asian chicken, cowboy barbecue chicken and vegan rainbow hummus along with take-and-bake cookies. Caffeinated drinks are made from an Equator Coffees bean blend and herbal teas and smoothies are available. Summer construction entailed creating a more open retail space by removing the wall separating the Sweet Things bake shop and former gift, clothing and home goods store At Home that Lasky and Leach opened in 2003. The tantalizing display case of sweets now extends across the rear wall, and a small set of tables remains in the corner by the entry. Petaluma graffiti muralist Magdalena Gross created a vibrant statement with a wide painted swath of red, orange and yellow swipes around the perimeter below the ceiling. Michael grew up in San Francisco, and during college at University of California, Berkeley, worked in restaurant kitchens, fell in love with baking and didn’t get out until her professional trajectory was interrupted by motherhood. When her children were old enough, she decided to open her first bakery, Jane on Fillmore, in 2011. Jane on Larkin and the beginning of a robust bread program and full catering department followed in 2013, Jane the Bakery on Geary Boulevard in 2016, Toy Boat by Jane on Clement Street in 2020 and Little Jane on Grant in 2022. Jane/Marin is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sundays in the Cove Shopping Center at 1 Blackfield Drive in Tiburon. To view the full menu, place orders for pickup or delivery or find information on catering or shipping, go to itsjane.com. ExtraFood, a Kentfield-based nonprofit organization that recovers excess fresh food from businesses, schools and gardens to reduce waste and delivers it to people throughout the Bay Area facing food insecurity, will have its second annual Fall Festival and 10th anniversary celebration from 2:30 to 5 p.m. Oct. 8 in Larkspur. Chef Heidi Krahling, owner of San Anselmo restaurants Insalata’s and Marinitas and an ExtraFood founding board member, will prepare carnitas tacos, grilled chicken kebobs, a fall grain salad and cilantro mint chutney. These dishes, specialty foods from ExtraFood donors and partners, including Comforts in San Anselmo and Whole Foods Market, and beer and wine are part of the ticket price.

2023-09-26	18:04:14+00:00	Claire Lawrence	EAT, PRAY, LOVE: Popular vegan spots leaves you falling in love with vegan options	https://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/27403/life-and-arts/eat-pray-love-popular-vegan-spots-leaves-you-falling-in-love-with-vegan-options/	Contrary to popular belief, vegans do not only “eat grass” or “bland food.” If you ever are curious about plant-based food, Rebel Cheese will leave you questioning if it really is vegan. Rebel Cheese, located on 2200 Aldrich Street, opened its doors in October of 2019. The establishment is located in a corner lot directly across from the Mueller Dog Park. The funky, 3D yellow sign that curves with their roofs’ structure is hard to miss. Their menu consists of a wide assortment of cheeses, sandwiches, soups, pastries and their sought-after charcuterie boards. Their variety of wines ensure that guests have plenty of options to choose from for the perfect pairing. Rebel Cheese showcases a wall of vegan gourmet groceries, such as hot chocolate mixing sticks, gummy candies, chips and more. Their incredibly sweet and informative staff is ready to answer any and all questions you may have about any of the items in store. Seating options include inside and outside tables. As a non-vegan, I was very perplexed but intrigued when I scrolled past a business claiming to have vegan charcuterie boards on Instagram. This came at a time when social media was going crazy over all and every kind of charcuterie board. Oh, and I should add that this was also roughly a year-or-so into the pandemic, which was a time when a lot of us were looking to try new things. “I’m not vegan, I don’t even want to try being vegan, but my wife loves to come and have wine here and get the cheeses and crackers,” Rebel Cheese regular, Jordan said, who was indulging in a charcuterie board with his wife on the patio. Rebel Cheese continues to be the place I take all people who are put off by vegan dishes. Anytime I go, I remember savoring their charcuterie board for the very first time in my car. I will never forget the shock that came over me when I remembered that there was absolutely no dairy in any of the cheeses I tried, which is why I am determined to hopefully convince one person who reads this article to go and give Rebel Cheese a try. As much as I have been mentioning their charcuterie boards, there are a couple other must-have items that will leave you questioning if what you’re eating is actually vegan. One of the newer items that I tried was their chicken bacon ranch sandwich. The soft and buttery pretzel buns held the delicious contents of the sandwich well. It consisted of their house-made vegan bacon, “chicken” strips, american cheese, ranch dressing, lettuce and tomato. Every single component of the sandwich tasted delicious. The texture of the meat-free proteins was the perfect texture and the “chicken” truly left me puzzled on how it was possible that there were zero chickens harmed in the making. “Working here is one of the reasons why I’m now vegan. Before I worked here, I wasn’t, but it opened my eyes to the vegan community,” Natalie, the front of house manager for Rebel Cheese, said. Another incredibly popular menu item, strongly suggested by Google reviews and staff, is the “bacon, brie, me” sandwich. This sandwich is packed with aged brie, bacon, caramelized onions, arugula and sweet fig jam from a baguette made in a local Austin bakery. There is no surprise why this is one of the popular menu items here. The blend of the salty bacon with the strong, sharp taste of brie hits your taste buds upon the first bite, followed by a tang of the fig jam. As someone who loves eating and even considers it a hobby, this sandwich left me full after devouring only one half. Not only does Rebel Cheese make the best vegan food I have ever had, they also love showing support to charities here in Austin.

Letters give voice to community members and do not represent VTDigger’s views. To submit a letter, follow the instructions here. The recent commentary about bulls implies that humans are doing animals a favor by breeding them for beef and dairy. Life for bulls and other animals is so miserable that we shouldn’t pat ourselves on the backs for bringing them into existence to serve our purposes. Bulls are sentient animals who feel pain, just as humans do. Yet bulls and other animals are bred and killed for food. On dairy farms, male calves are taken from their mothers and raised for veal. They’re fed foods that are low in iron, so they’ll be anemic and their flesh will stay pale. The only way to be sure that animals don’t suffer on your behalf is to go vegan. Choose milks made from oats, soy, nuts, and other plant foods. Kind people don’t want to support cruelty to animals, so they’re opting for vegan milks, which are delicious, nutritious, and environmentally friendly. Vegan foods generate fewer greenhouse gases, and studies show that the only way to feed the growing population by 2050, without destroying more forests for grazing land, is for everyone to go vegan. Fortunately, it’s easy for Vermonters to get produce, grains, legumes, vegan milks, and other healthy vegan foods, as I have for the 20 years I’ve been vegan, at local stores and restaurants.

Noelle Obcarskas, 64, is facing jail after she was found guilty of harassment. In one video, Obcarskas refuses to move her car after a neighbour shouts to her to move it from outside her house, repeating 'do it, do it'. And when she tells the neighbour she's had 'enough abuse,' the latter retaliates with 'don't talk s***'. She then continues screaming 'move your car' and threatens to have it towed away, accusing Obcarskas of deliberately causing trouble, being obnoxious and a 'b**** from hell'. Another video posted by Obcarskas showed her rambling about 'vegan cats' in a nonsensical rant as she gave a tour around her garden. In one video Obcarskas called company director John McKimmie, 40, a 'little fat bully with a skivvy wife' as he remonstrated with her for deliberately blocking his driveway with large pieces of foam. She insists 'it's not my litter - it's been there for months.' Noelle Obcarskas, 64, paraded her turkeys down the street while chatting to them on film She also posted a message on a Facebook community page about the father of two saying: 'Words cannot and are inadequate to describe this display of total t***. No wonder his kids are tongue tied and speechless in his presence when he repeatedly tells them to say something.' In her campaign vegan Obcarskas targeted 73-year-old Gareth Lloyd who complained about the smell of the turkeys. She called him and Mr McKimmie 't***s', 'd***heads', and 'c***s' and added: 'They have left their irrelevant a*** wiping skivvy fishwives out of having anything to say being mere females... In their ego little d*** minds, they are not even ladies.' In another of her videos Obcarskas filmed herself goading Mr Lloyd outside his home which she posted on YouTube. During the verbal exchange a clearly frustrated Mr Lloyd who was filming Obcarskas on his iPad to get evidence for police was heard telling her: 'You are one obnoxious evil woman' and adding: 'You're top of the class when it comes to stupid. If you're on these videos, it would be X-rated... because of your looks.' In the same film, Obcarskas who has also has two 'vegan dogs' and a 'vegan cat' panned her camera to a third neighbouring property as a woman screamed: 'You're a 100% hypocrite!' at her from her bedroom window. In a different video she filmed herself having a slanging match with the same neighbour over the parking of her Renault people carrier outside their adjoining homes. Videos on YouTube showed Obcarskas parading her turkeys on the street, while seeming to chat to them. Obcarskas, of Pulford, Chester, posted a series of bizarre films online of her having explosive rows Chester Magistrates' Court heard one row was over her turkeys, which she denies Obcarskas insists that she is the victim of a hate campaign, which began after the UK voted for Brexit in 2016. She said her car had been vandalised, flowers and plants ripped up from her gardens and rubbish dumped on her drive. Obcarskas, who walks with a stick, said she became enraged when she contacted the police after discovering a neighbour had been leaving rubbish behind her car – only for the cops to back the culprit. She said it was then she posted the videos. Obcarskas, of Pulford, Chester, posted a series of bizarre films online of her having explosive rows.

2023-09-26	04:23:55+00:00	Melissa Fitzgerald	REVIEW: The New Moto Phone Looks Luxe But Is Only $229	https://www.smarthouse.com.au/review-the-new-moto-phone-looks-luxe-but-is-only-229/	The moto g14 is a 4G champion that has a lot to offer for a low price point. With the crisp photos, impressive battery life and look of the phone, this device is perfect for households feeling the pinch of cost-of-living pressures. Motorola’s new moto g14 has a sleek look, a pale lilac colour we loved, and is a mid-tier smartphone featuring immersive stereo speakers, a full HD+ display with an advanced camera, all for only $229. The new moto g14 has style and substance as it is made from vegan leather and has a water-repellent design, protecting it from spills and splashes. It’s also pretty much fingerprint proof! The moto g14 is fresh off the assembly line with a glossy design and several premium features, including but not limited to Dolby Atmos speakers with Motorola Spatial Sound and a 6.5-inch Full HD+ (2400 x 1080) display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. For the camera, Motorola uses Macro Vision, which offers crisp images and also employs a dual-camera rear array led by its 50MP main lens in addition to a 2MP macro lens for taking up-close photos. Whereas on the front, an 8MP lens is used for taking selfies. All images are optimised using AI. When I tested the device’s camera, I found the photos to be clear and crisp. Actually, I was surprised because based upon the price point, I assumed the camera would not match my Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, but it performed quite well. The Quad Pixel technology is claimed to be 4x better low light sensitivity, which should allow users to take better pictures in low-light situations when using the main camera, which seems to be true when we use the example below of the photo. The low-light pictures of the North Sydney skyline were impressive, but don’t take my word for it. Check out the evidence, i.e., the photos below for yourself. The proof is in the image below, which shows the camera’s ability to take pictures with both low-light and almost sunlight from behind an object from a distance. Some of the other images, like of the close-up of flowers, did not pixelate or distort when I enlarged an image, which is something usually only premium phones have.’ When using TikTok, I could see the Hole-in-Display (HiD) design, condensed border between the screen and frame in action, which allowed for a pretty sweet scrolling experience. As for the sound, the Dolby Atmos speakers with Motorola Spatial Sound worked well when I was at home playing music to distract myself while doing light housework. When I caught up on the Real Housewives of Sydney from the comfort of my bed, I also found the sound to be really clear. When we talk about the tech powering the phone, the moto g14 has a powerful Octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, runs off of Android 13, and 128GB of built-in storage. As for the battery, it’s not bad with its 5000 mAh, which should last a couple of days if you find yourself without a charger. Also, I was pleased to see that the moto g14 also brought back the headphone jack, which not many current phones can boast. I’m making a case for this now, can more phone manufacturers do this! I am forever only 50% charged on my headphones, but I digress. Back to the moto g14 – Overall, I was pleased with the phone’s capabilities, especially for the price, which is a point of pride for Kurt Bonnici, Head of Motorola for Australia and New Zealand. “Through our Moto G family, we continue to democratise new technology, making the latest innovation and features widely accessible, ensuring every consumer can find a device that not only meets their needs, but exceeds their expectation of a mid-tier smartphone,” Bonnici said. Want to snatch up your own g14? The new g14 phones are available in Steel Gray or an eye-catching Pale Lilac finish and are available now at retailers including JB Hi-Fi, Big W, Amazon, and direct from Motorola.

We've received your submission. Butter late than never. A woman says her health is now better than ever after quitting veganism in favor of the “carnivore diet.” In addition to chowing down on heapings of steak, eggs and other animal-derived dishes, Victoria Ferraz, 23, is known to treat herself to a stick of raw butter. The law student, from Atlanta, Georgia, has been on the carnivore diet for 7 months after falling for what she described as “vegan propaganda” and eating only plant products for a year. Her flirtation with veganism was a big mis-steak, she told Jam Press. “Everything’s better with carnivore, my hair, my teeth, my nails. My body has de-flamed. Now, I have so much energy, I don’t feel bloated. My acne went away,” Ferraz said. Ever since ditching plant-based milk and opting for raw dairy and meat, Ferraz claims that her acne, joint pain and bloating have vanished, as well as the unpleasant stench that came with her plant-based poops. She says she also no longer needs to take medicine for hypothyroidism. Now, Ferraz decides what to eat based on what her body is telling her. “Every day is different for me because your body tells you what it wants. Right now, for breakfast and dinner I eat rib-eyes, top sirloin cap, pork belly, a lot of eggs, bacon, patties, butter, tallow, that whole range of animal-based products,” she explained. “I completely eliminated sugar of all types: fruits, carbs, and processed sugar. I eat no plants, no veggies.” Minus eating a few blueberries here and there, she sticks to meat and animal products and has “no days off.” She vowed to never go plant-based again. Ferraz grew up eating “everything,” including meat. She said a desire to lose weight inspired her to give veganism a try. “For a long time, I would eat everything a normal person would eat, I didn’t restrict myself,” she said. “Then I saw the propaganda about plant-based food and a burger that is just seed oils and water and chemicals. I bought into it because I wanted to lose weight.” Ferraz also once thought she was lactose intolerant. She later deduced that her body had trouble adjusting to veganism and suffered symptoms as a result. “I had a lot of gut issues like bloating. I felt so tired. I had a lot of bad acne. I had joint pain in my jaw, sinus issues, and headaches almost every day. Talking to many professionals and many doctors, I’d tell them things about me and they’d say ‘This is normal,'” she said. “But it wasn’t normal and I couldn’t feel like that every day.” Now she’s feeling healthy — though some people on social media have a bone to pick with her about her lifestyle habits. Ferraz posts videos to TikTok under the moniker @vic.ferraz where her content racks up thousands of views. In response to people who assume her bowel movements “must stink,” she begs to differ. “This might be TMI but everyone says ‘your bathroom must stink’ — but I’m not eating processed foods or sugars or seed oils or the oxalates that are inflaming [our bodies],” she claimed. She said people are quick to judge her, but the “carnivore community” is growing and she hopes her story inspires others to rethink their diet. She said haters are merely “misinformed” and she hopes people will “do their research” before switching to any diet. Ferraz may have found success with the carnivore diet, but according to Healthline, it’s not necessarily safe. “No controlled studies support claims that the carnivore diet can help eliminate health issues. It lacks beneficial nutrients, including fiber and plant compounds like antioxidants. It may be unsafe for some people,” says Healthline’s website. “The carnivore diet eliminates all foods except meat and animal products. Thus, it’s lacking in numerous nutrients like fiber, loaded with salt and fat, and difficult to maintain. You should follow a well-rounded diet instead,” their website continues. Ferraz isn’t the only influencer touting the benefits of a meat-only diet. TikTok sensation Courtney Luna, 38, says chowing down on meat helped her get clear skin, lose weight, and beat her anxiety. Former vegan and influencer Alyse Parker ate nothing but meat and animal products for 30 days and said she felt healthier than she had in years.

Law student Victoria Ferraz, from Atlanta, has been on the 'carnivore diet' for seven months after rejecting what she calls 'vegan propaganda.' The 23-year-old has also cut out all sugar and carbohydrates after a year-long stint with veganism turned out to be the 'worst decision of her life.' Ever since the student gave up her devotion to almond and oat milk in favor of raw cow's milk, Victoria claims her joint pain, acne, and bloating have all vanished, and that she no longer needs to take medication for hypothyroidism. A former vegan claims cutting out all fruit and vegetables and eating a strict 'carnivore diet' of only meat, eggs and sticks of raw butter helped her wave goodbye to smelly toilet visits She claims her change of eating has improved her hair, nails, acne and health, and laughs off those who suggest her toilet 'must stink' She typically eats two to four eggs for breakfast with bacon or grass-fed beef patties, drinks butter in her coffee and enjoys rib-eye steaks for dinner every night. Victoria claims her change of eating has improved her hair, nails, acne, and health, and she laughs off those who suggest her toilet 'must stink.' Now feeling better than ever, she hopes to share her journey with her diet in the hopes of encouraging others to join the 'carnivore community,' and wave goodbye to their sugar and greens. Victoria said: 'Every day is different for me because your body tells you what it wants. 'Right now, for breakfast and dinner I eat ribeyes, top sirloin cap, pork belly, a lot of eggs, bacon, patties, butter, tallow, that whole range of animal-based products. 'I completely eliminated sugar of all types: fruits, carbs, and processed sugar. I eat no plants, no veggies. 'There's no days off. I would never go back to those foods because I felt so bad and now I feel so good. 'I'd never put my body through that again. I admit the worst decision in my life was agreeing that [veganism] was correct. She typically eats two to four eggs for breakfast with bacon or grass-fed beef patties and drinks butter in her coffee (right). She previously had a green smoothie for breakfast (left) 'I had hypothyroidism. I was told I'd have to deal with it for the rest of my life. Now I see that isn't true. 'My goal has been to get off medication. My doctor looked at my labs yesterday and said no one that has labs like yours has hypothyroidism.' Victoria was brought up as a child on a diet full of meat, rice, beans and salads and often enjoyed biscuits and baked goods at breakfast. After turning plant-based for a year in her 20s, due to vegan 'propaganda' and wanting to lose weight, her health deteriorated - but she was told by doctors her bloating and lack of energy were normal. 'For a long time, I would eat everything a normal person would eat, I didn't restrict myself,' Victoria said. 'Then I saw the propaganda about plant-based food and a burger that is just seed oils and water and chemicals. 'I bought into it because I wanted to lose weight. I was crazy, it had to be almond milk or oat milk. I thought people who drank raw milk were crazy. 'I used to think that I was intolerant to dairy. I had a lot of gut issues like bloating. I felt so tired. I had a lot of bad acne. 'I had joint pain in my jaw, sinus issues, and headaches almost every day. 'Talking to many professionals and many doctors, I'd tell them things about me and they'd say: "This is normal." Since turning to the carnivore diet, she claims her two animal-based meals a day (right) have now kicked all of her previous health issues. She previously had wraps and granola bowls (left) 'But it wasn't normal and I couldn't feel like that every day,' she explained. Since turning to the carnivore diet, she claims her two animal-based meals a day have now kicked all of her previous health issues and blames them on sugar and 'oxalates' - compounds found in fruits, nuts, and seeds. Other than the occasional blueberry on 'very rare' occasions, Victoria has not eaten fruit or vegetables since February due to these oxalates, which she believes were the cause of her full body 'inflammation.' Victoria even admitted that despite online comments suggesting her trips to the bathroom 'must stink,' her toilet has never been fresher. 'Everything's better with [being a] carnivore, my hair, my teeth, my nails,' she said. 'My body has de-flamed. Now, I have so much energy, I don't feel bloated. My acne went away. 'Veggies with high amounts of oxalates cause a lot of inflammation in our bodies. 'Very rarely I'll have a few blueberries, but right now I'm trying really hard to not have any of that. 'This might be TMI but everyone says "your bathroom must stink" but I'm not eating processed foods or sugars or seed oils or the oxalates that are inflaming us. 'These are what make us have to empty out our bowels every day because you're eating so much trash. Her videos have more than 20,000 likes and she hopes sharing her meals will get more people interested in the carnivore diet 'When you aren't, everything is fresh and normal. People are okay eating donuts everyday or eating their frappe latte that has 300 grams of sugar but they have a problem with me eating meat.' Her videos have more than 20,000 likes and she hopes sharing her meals will get more people interested in the carnivore diet. 'Carnivore is a growing community and I want to share my story to help others be aware of the opportunity they can have away from medication and have a quality life,' Victoria said. 'Some people on the carnivore diet eat fruit or they eat some veggies, but I don't promote any of that because of the sugar and the problems it causes. 'I don't even blame [haters], I think they're just misinformed. 'I think anyone interested in the diet should do their research and maybe do it by slowly cutting things out and increasing meat and fat.' The National Health Service online suggests: 'Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals in your diet.' However, if you currently eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red or processed meat a day, the Department of Health and Social Care advises that you cut down to 70g. If you currently eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red or processed meat a day, the Department of Health and Social Care advises that you cut down to 70g NHS advice from the University Hospitals Sussex website on oxalates is to avoid overconsumption only if you have kidney stones. Only 10 to 15% of urinary oxalate comes from your dietary intake. It is not, therefore, necessary to eliminate oxalate-containing foods completely from your diet. You should, however, aim for a moderate (and sensible) intake of oxalates. The comments below have not been moderated.

2023-09-25	08:17:08+00:00	Matt Strudwick	Employers are offering free vegan meals and fish and chips lunches in bid to lure workers back to the office - as M&G boss orders staff back in three days a week as 'the City's too empty on Fridays'	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12556887/KPMG-working-home-free-meals.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490	 Published: 08:59 BST, 25 September 2023 | Updated: 11:19 BST, 25 September 2023 Employers are offering free vegan meals and fish and chip Fridays to try and tempt workers back to the office. It comes after a survey by Ipsos found working three days a week in the office was the 'right balance' with many enjoying the hybrid set-up. But workers are being offered 'perks' including lunchtime meals and networking opportunities in a bid to try and coax people back after the pandemic forced employees to be rooted to their desks at home. Big Four accounting firm KPMG - which employs 14,000 people in the UK - said it gave the freebie to workers including offers of vegan meals and the British staple 'fish and chip Fridays'. It comes amid a push to get people back to offices, with chief executive of London-based global investment manager M&G, Andrea Rossi revealing he had ordered staff back to the office for at least three days a week because 'the City's too empty on Fridays'. 'We tried some things early on, which I think the Ipsos report talks about, in terms of perks,' KPMG chief people officer Lisa Fernihough told BBC Radio 4 presenter Mishal Hussain. 'We tried free vegan meals on Mondays and fish and chips on Fridays. I wouldn't say that was thing that drew them back. 'What we are finding is the biggest thing that draws people back is the opportunities to work with people that they know, to network, to have those interactions that you just can't get in the same way when you are working remotely on Teams or Zoom.' In 2021, KPMG told its 18,000 UK workforce they will work in the office for up to four days in a fortnight under a hybrid working model drawn up following the decline in British Covid cases. Ms Fernihough said its guidance of working two to three days in the office currently offers the best mix. 'So far that is our experience, I think the other comment is we are still in a test and learn,' she said. 'We've come out of the pandemic we are working in this way. Who knows where we are going to be in five or ten years in terms of how this works. For now absolutely this is working well.' Mr Rossi told The Times he likes to be in the office. 'I get a bit frustrated when I come in on a Friday because the whole City, it’s empty, he said. 'M&G has an enormous opportunity to sustainably grow this business in the coming years, even in the coming months, and it’s important to get more people together.' Ipsos Karian Box's survey found the time it takes to get to and from work and having to fork out for lunch were stopping people from going back to the office. The chief executive of M&G, Andrea Rossi, has ordered his managers back to the office three days a week and said the 'whole City is empty' on Fridays Ghassan Karian, chief executive of Ipsos Karian and Box, said: 'In the responses to our survey, three days in the office came out as the optimum solution. 'It strikes the right balance that realises the benefits of office working for both employer and employee, while also giving individuals the ability to think, work and manage their home lives in a flexible way.' The 'Making The Case For The Office' report highlighted those working in the office four days a week also make quicker decisions. While 53 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 'always or frequently' feel lonely if they work fewer than three days in the office. A survey by recruitment company Robert Walters this week revealed Generation Z lack the social skills to work in teams. It found half of those aged 18 to 24 preferred working alone rather than in a team, reported The Times. Two-thirds of managers also felt Gen Z was destroying team culture. Last week, a survey by Ambl found 40% of Brits who work from home say not being in the office all week has made them fundamentally unspontaneous and boring - more likely to reject night out plans then agree to them. The research, which looked at 2,000 working adults, found that 30 per cent believe Covid took all the spark from their lives and that still has not returned. While civil servants face a ‘working from home’ crackdown under plans being drawn up by ministers. Downing Street is poised to issue new guidance to all Whitehall departments in a bid to end the culture of ‘Tuesday to Thursday’ working which has developed since the pandemic. The new push will be led by Paymaster General Jeremy Quin to tackle plummeting public sector productivity, it has been reported. Meanwhile, hundreds of council staff are 'working from the beach' – with a ten-fold increase in the number allowed to log in from abroad. Town hall bosses have granted more than 1,350 requests to work from overseas over the past three years, figures show. The number jumped from 73 approvals in 2020/21, the year the Covid-19 pandemic was at its height, to 440 in 2021/22. In August, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said company workers who defy his directive to return to the office for a minimum of three days a week may be best placed to leave the company altogether. During a 'fishbowl' meeting, he expressed frustration over employees not taking his return-to-office policy seriously and told those refusing to come in for the three-day minimum: 'It's probably not going to work out for you.' Zoom recently recently ordered its staff back to the office and said those who live within a 50-mile radius of an office should work in person at least twice a week. The company has a workforce of between 5,000 and 10,000, according to its LinkedIn page, with around 200 working in its new UK office in London. A spokesperson for the firm said: 'We believe that a structured hybrid approach – meaning a set number of days employees that live near an office need to be on site – is most effective for Zoom.

Another facade that no one should ever think of compromising comes to their diet. Bodybuilders of all ages have strictly instructed the other generations to stick to a disciplined diet regime if they want to sculpt their bodies according to their wishes. However, as the contemporary era looms, a few shocking incidents leave the fans shocked. The internet sensation, and preacher of Veganism, Korin Sutton calls himself a Vegan Coach. Apparently winning 23 bodybuilding competitions, he has become a known celebrity in the community. However, as soon as his post goes viral, the community treats his claims with a grain of salt. In a recent Facebook post by @Vegan Bodybuilding & Fitness, they shared Korin Sutton’s Instagram post. In the caption of the post they extensively talk about the achievements Sutton had been able to bag in his career. However, when the post stated, “Korin Sutton has been vegan for a decade, and has won 23 bodybuilding competitions as a vegan bodybuilder”, fans go crazy speculative. They deny and mock the facts as portrayed on the Facebook page. Furthermore, the rejection from fans arose more, as the additional information written in the caption had been a rather triggering and extremely rare phenomenon within the community. It said, “He shows people all over the world that plants have all the protein we need”. 37.8k readers Last 30 min October 07, 2023 02:27 am EDT October 07, 2023 07:47 am EDT October 07, 2023 08:02 pm EDT October 06, 2023 06:29 pm EDT October 07, 2023 04:18 pm EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest Bodybuilding stories via Google! Click on Follow Us and Tap the Blue Star. “F**K, Something Bad Gonna Happen”: Chris Bumstead Confesses an Absurd Childhood Memory That Made Him Terrified to Look at the Clock The bodybuilding community rejects and denies all claims of the bodybuilder presented before them to be vegan. Not only do they get extremely shocked, but they speculate about several negative possibilities. One of the fans said, “How the hell is he winning bodybuilding shows with that physique? 😂😂 obviously he’s in good shape, but that’s a terrible physique for a bodybuilder.” Another made a sarcastic comment, “Clearly trying to smuggle in a baby back rib.” Another speculated that it must have been steroids instead of meat. They stated, “Ahhhh so no meat and lots of roids is all you need”. Yet another fan remarked, “Vegan competition he won de GrassNold Classic and he is part of the IVBF”. Last, but not least, someone said, “Plants have all the protein we need, but he’s in hella supplements. Get real“. Enjoyed Your Read? Let us know how likely you are to recommend EssentiallySports to your friends! It is not easy to get out of the strong myths that persist in the bodybuilding community. But again, seeing the absolute truth, and the make-believe false presentations, would always get caught by the public eyes. As no one is ready to believe in the Vegan bodybuilder, the community finds a humorous adventure in the comments in his post.

2023-09-23	11:00:26+00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha	Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for baked potatoes with chipotle beans | The new vegan	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/sep/23/vegan-baked-sweet-potatoes-chipotle-beans-tahini-guacamole-recipe-meera-sodha	I’ve been smitten with Tex-Mex food since the early 90s. This dish moves things along, but it still hits the same flavourful spot My first taste of Tex-Mex was at the Chiquito in the Kingston Retail Park, Hull, in the early 1990s. The lady on the next table ordered a margarita and a chimichanga, which sounded ludicrously exciting. I watched (along with everyone else in the place) as a sizzling fajita landed on another table. Aged 10, I was smitten. I’ve not been to Texas, but would love to one day; in the meantime, I’m content with reading my favourite Texas tome, The Homesick Texan Cookbook by Lisa Fain, and riffing on the flavours within. You’ll need a wide frying pan for which you have a lid. The sweet potatoes and beans should come together at the same time, but if that doesn’t happen, keep the potatoes warm in the oven with the heat turned off. Chipotle paste can be found in most major supermarkets. 6 sweet potatoes (about 1.3kg)Fine sea salt3 tbsp rapeseed oil2 red onions, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed40g dark chocolate, chopped2 tbsp chipotle paste – I like the one by Cool Chile1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes2 x 400g tins black beans, not drained2 ripe avocados1 tbsp tahini2 limes, 1 juiced, to get 1½ tbsp, the other cut into wedges, to serve Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Rinse the sweet potatoes, then sprinkle a large pinch of salt on each one. Put the potatoes on an oven tray, then bake for 40 minutes, or until tender. In the meantime, make the beans. Put the oil in a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until soft and starting to brown. Add the garlic, cook for two minutes more, then stir in the chocolate, chipotle, tomatoes, black beans and their water, and a half-teaspoon of salt. Bring to a bubble, then turn down the heat, pop on a lid and leave to cook, stirring every now and then, for 20 minutes. To make the tahini guacamole, halve, stone and peel the avocados, then mash the flesh in a bowl until soft. Stir in the tahini, lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and set aside. To serve, put a sweet potato on each of four plates, then slit open and pull apart slightly. Generously spoon over the beans and dollop over the guacamole. There’s an extra half a sweet potato each for anyone who’s still hungry.

Then you're no feminist, say animal rights activists in the latest woke protest against those who have a non-vegan diet	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12550913/Eggs-milk-feminist-animal-rights-activists-protest-non-vegan-diet.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490	 Published: 22:46 BST, 22 September 2023 | Updated: 02:27 BST, 23 September 2023 Women cannot be feminists if they drink milk and eat eggs, according to animal rights activists. In the latest woke backlash against non-vegan diets, campaign group PETA has likened the artificial insemination of dairy cows to the sexual abuse of women. Meanwhile it says female chickens are treated like 'egg-laying machines' - an act of sexism which causes reproductive problems. Women should show solidarity with females of other species if they are true feminists, according to the organisation in a blog published on its website this week entitled 'You can't be a feminist if you're drinking milk and eating eggs.' It states: 'The meat, egg, and dairy industries are built on the exploitation of female animals - something that no one should support. 'Every time you order or request a vegan meal, you're standing up for females.' The radical group adds: 'The denial of animal rights originates in the same supremacist thinking that has obstructed women's rights.' The activist organisation says chickens can suffer from cysts, infections and tumours because their bodies are forced to produce unnaturally high quantities of eggs (file image) Responding to the blog, Frank Furedi, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent, said: 'Peta are obviously hijacking the cultural authority of feminism to validate their attempt to guilt-trip people to change their diet. 'To achieve their objective they erode the distinction between human and animals and in effect animalise people.' The latest bids for attention from PETA, which is famous for using naked female celebrities to publicise its campaigns, have included criticising Lego for using farmyard scenes which they claim mislead children about the 'bloodsoaked' reality of farming. It has called for sporting terms like 'wormburner' in golf and 'hot dog' to be changed because they apparently normalise violence towards animals, and says pets should be called 'companion animals' to avoid suggesting they are a commodity. The new blog says farming is 'entirely reliant on female exploitation' with animals being 'violated without consent'. On dairy farms, PETA says cows are repeatedly 'forcibly impregnated' through artificial insemination, with their calves taken away so they can be milked. Female pigs are also artificially inseminated, with the blog stating: 'At a time when women are rising up against sexual abuse, PETA is asking everyone to show solidarity with females of ALL species - who each experience fear and pain, just as humans do - and go vegan.' Female pigs are also artificially inseminated, with the blog stating: 'At a time when women are rising up against sexual abuse, PETA is asking everyone to show solidarity with females of ALL species' (file image) The activist organisation says chickens can suffer from cysts, infections and tumours because their bodies are forced to produce unnaturally high quantities of eggs. Meanwhile female pigs are confined to farrowing crates so small they can't even turn around, to reduce the risk of them crushing their piglets after giving birth. Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union, said: 'Peta have jumped the shark with this latest campaign. 'The idea of extending women's rights to other species is completely bonkers. 'Is Peta intending to police the animal kingdom to make sure that the female of every species has given her express consent before having sex? Good luck with that.' ADD:In 2018, in the US, PETA put up a billboard with the slogan 'Face It-You Can't Claim to Be a Feminist and Still Eat Eggs.' The advertisement, in San Jose, also stated: 'Eggs and Dairy Are a Product of the Abuse of Females.' The comments below have not been moderated.

2023-09-22	05:51:39+00:00	Jimmy Videle	Veganic Farming: How My Tiny Plot Produced 5,000 Pounds of Food Without Using Manure	https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/09/22/veganic-farming-how-my-tiny-plot-produced-5000-pounds-of-food-without-using-manure/	Is it possible to grow food without exploiting animals in gardening/homesteading and farming systems? Even if we do not keep domesticated animals, isn’t it necessary to at least use animal manure? The veganic way of growing shows us that not only is it possible to grow fruits, vegetables, and herbs without manure but it is also productive, ecologically sustainable, and regenerative for our rapidly depleting agricultural soils. Veganic farming is the growing, gardening, cultivation, and production of food and fiber crops with a minimal amount of exploitation of animal and plant species. Veganic methods use no animal products or byproducts, such as blood meal, bone meal, manure, urea, fish meal, fish emulsion, or any other animal-originated matter, because the production of these products either harms animals specifically or is connected with their subsequent suffering. Furthermore, while “organic” cultivation allows for the use of organo-pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides and conventional cultivation uses all manner of chemical toxins, veganics does not do so as applying and spraying these poisons highly disrupt the native floral and faunal balance of the growing systems and is against the main philosophy of this form of agriculture of cultivating for the benefit of all beings. Veganic growing is an important step to ensure that we break the chain of animal agriculture in our farming systems. Adopting this approach has become increasingly important given the negative impact large-scale animal farming has on our environment. The idea behind veganic farming might sound good in theory, but do these models exist and are they sustainable? In 2014, Mélanie Bernier and I established La Ferme de l’Aube with a vision of what could be possible to grow veganically and productively for all beings to share. We created a small micro farm/homestead on less than half-acre of space on our six-acre property with the intention of letting the rest rewild. We strive to increase soil organic matter (SOM) using plant-based composts and green manures (cover crops), including buckwheat, clover, and oats. We cover the soil in winter by allowing all garden plants and native flora to freeze and rest on the low or no-till permanent beds. Two soil tests comparing soil organic matter and soil organic carbon (SOC) were taken in 2016 and 2022, respectively, and revealed a 38.46 percent increase in the presence of these components in the soil samples. pH = power of Hydrogen is the relative acidity/alkalinity of soils (7.0 = neutral) We cultivate more than 400 varieties of fruits, vegetables, herbs, flowers, shrubs, and trees. Through these annual and perennial plantings, we seek to invite a biodiverse faunal realm of insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and animals. In 2018, we conducted a farm-wide biodiversity study to obtain a better understanding of the inhabitants living on the land. The results were impressive. More than 150 species of spiders, butterflies, bees, beetles, and other insects were also found on the farm, but this was only scratching the surface as many more were undocumented due to my lack of training, and not for the lack of them living here. In August of 2018, a bumblebee point count observed 80 individuals. In 2022 that population grew to 182, an incredible 228 percent increase. There were six endangered monarch butterflies in August of 2018. In August 2022, 25 were observed, the highest number recorded on the farm. All indicators in 2022 pointed to the fact that all faunal numbers had increased. This data proves to us that cultivated diversity and rewilding are improving the ecosystem for all residents and migrants. For the monarchs, we made a concerted effort to rewild vast milkweed patches along with those growing in our cultivated gardens, which is the plant necessary for the monarch’s survival. Food production for human consumption began in earnest in 2017. In five years, the total production grew from 9,440 to 13,689 kilograms per hectare—a 45 percent increase. From 2018 onward, the farm provided nourishment to 40 families per week for 15 weeks and eliminated a food desert in our region. It provided us with a year-round food supply as well. All this was being done with almost no waste; it amounted to a mere 1 percent of post-harvest production. Because it just seemed to make sense, we created a thriving artisanal seed company specializing in open-pollinated and heirloom varieties. We felt that the production was so exceptional that I initiated a study in December 2018 in cooperation with the Humane Party, the first vegan, abolitionist political party in the United States, comparing veganic to conventional and organic agriculture methods. We found that veganic was 3 percent more productive than conventional and 41 percent more productive than organic agriculture, respectively. Further, when comparing vegan agriculture to the best animal agriculture model, it was found to be more than 4,000 percent more productive, acre per acre. As gardeners and farmers, we can make a difference with every planting season by practicing solid, ecological, and veganic principles. Revolution in agriculture is on our doorstep. We can change how we treat our “Earth Mother” with every action. All inhabitants on this planet deserve life and the right to live as they see fit. Once we learn that we can grow efficiently, productively, and compassionately, while keeping the welfare of all beings in mind, we can begin to see the way forward in adopting these sustainable practices as alternatives to animal agriculture.

A vegan diet is one such form that requires the followers to avoid all animal-based foods as a source of nutrition. Many celebrities are known to follow a vegan diet, including Serena Williams and Jennifer Lopez. Now, a fitness influencer shares his experience following a vegan diet. Tanner Shuck is a YouTuber with 148K subscribers, known for his fitness-related content. He keeps his followers updated on his workout and diet rituals. The DFC Fitness Champ recently shared his vegan journey for a month. In the video, “I Went Vegan for 30 Days: Here’s What Happened,” Shuck recalls how everything was perfect when he was getting enough proteins, training at the gym, and sleeping eight hours before he went vegan for a month. Calling his dietary switch, a “stupid” decision, the fitness influencer explains the hardships he faced after eliminating animal sources for his vegan journey. “I was constantly hungry even though I was eating over 4000 calories a day sometimes, and I never felt full, and definitely one of my biggest concerns and hardest parts about being vegan was getting enough quality protein and nutrients,” the YouTuber confessed. Shuck depended on tofu, beans, and rice during his vegan journey. 2.8k readers Last 30 min October 09, 2023 04:45 am EDT October 09, 2023 08:36 am EDT October 05, 2023 07:39 pm EDT October 08, 2023 09:29 pm EDT October 09, 2023 05:24 am EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest NFL stories via Google!

Real talk, one night my girlfriend threatened to break up with me because my gas was so bad,” the fitness influencer narrated his sad plight. Shuck also complained of gaining fat, brain fog, and low libido due to the new diet. So, he had to quit his vegan journey on the 30th day. However, celebrities like Serena Williams and Jennifer Lopez credited vegan diets for their fitness. Serena Williams is known for her great strength on the Tennis court, and she is the epitome of fitness in her forties. The 4x Olympic gold winner revealed her reason for opting for a vegan lifestyle. “I think it’s just really good to clean out your system sometimes just to get rid of all the waste and things like that that are just in your system,” she said. Jennifer Lopez, Hollywood’s most iconic star, also credited vegan diet for losing her baby fat in 2008. “I did full vegan for almost four, five weeks and then I just started incorporating a little bit more proteins and things like that,” the pop star confessed in an interview with Extra. However, she is not on a vegan diet of late, as per Insider. Enjoyed Your Read? Let us know how likely you are to recommend EssentiallySports to your friends! “He’s Still a Kid”: 21-Y.O.

Learn the facts before going vegan	https://baylorlariat.com/2023/09/21/green-thumb-or-just-dumb-learn-the-facts-before-going-vegan/	By now, we’ve all heard the elevator pitch from that one vegan friend. You know, the one who says, “Being vegan is so much healthier for you!” and swears up and down that the diet is not only healthier than eating meat, but somehow cheaper too? Incredulous, you walk into Whole Foods, and all of the snacks are “meatless beef jerky” or “vegan ricotta cheese.” You’re left wondering how it’s even possible to make meatless meat and cheese that somehow didn’t come from an animal — not just more healthy than the real thing, but less expensive as well. That’s because it isn’t. The whole time vegans and vegetarians have been buying into this well-meaning lifestyle of cruelty-free, environmentally friendly products, they’ve also been sold a “greenwashed” lie. There is no world where cutting out the biggest and most bioavailable source of protein, iron, vitamins and fatty acids is good for you. Living on a diet of soy, nuts and fruit — while simultaneously downing a handful of pills and supplements just to make sure you don’t faint — isn’t really living. While it’s true that vegans and vegetarians have been shown to have less association with cardiovascular disease, liver disease and obesity, per the National Institutes of Health, evidence also suggests that these diets leave people more susceptible to nervous, skeletal and immune system impairments, blood disease and mental health deterioration due to malnutrition. Talk about a clean diet. That’s a lot of health risks, but at least vegans are saving money, right? Wrong again. Compare one 8-ounce container of grated parmesan from H-E-B for $4.31 to a two-pack of 4-ounce containers of “dairy-free grated topping” for $16.54 on Amazon. The non-vegan cheese is $0.54 per ounce, while the vegan stuff is $2.07 for the same. And while there are some vegans and vegetarians who maintain that their lifestyle saves them money, the NIH shows a majority of vegans take supplement pills and vitamin gummies that can cost a pretty penny. A quick Google search reveals most supplements marketed toward vegans are around the $30 mark for a month’s supply. And the downsides of the lifestyle don’t stop there. Of course, everyone should care about the treatment of animals, and it’s a sad reality that our furry friends are often abused on industrial farms as well as in cosmetic testing. To circumvent the impact of animal cruelty, many vegans and vegetarians boycott the sale of leather and furs in favor of what they call “vegan leather.” What is vegan leather, you may ask? None other than plastic. Yes, the same plastic that pollutes the water we drink and mucks up marine wildlife habitats, killing an estimated 100,000 marine mammals each year, according to the World Wildlife Fund — not to mention the fact that fast fashion companies are the leading contributor to air pollution and a huge offender of workers rights. So, when the well-meaning vegetarian consumer shops for vegan leather rather than thrifting or wearing a hand-me-down leather or fur jacket, they’re not doing any favors for the animals at all. In fact, they’re valuing animal life over the lives of child laborers and the future of the planet. If you’re vegan or vegetarian and your diet works for you and your wallet while also making you feel healthy, that’s amazing. However, the diet and lifestyle are not feasible for everyone, and it takes money and dedication, as well as being in tune with your body and knowing its limits. If you’re on the fence about cutting meat and other animal products from your diet, be my guest, but be aware of all the facts before making such a commitment, and don’t be swayed by “greenwashed” marketing and false information.

Schoolboy, 10, returns to the Today show with ANOTHER cheeky quip after his vegan gag shocked hosts	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12542467/Vegan-joke-Schoolboy-returns-Today-cheeky-quip.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490	 Published: 00:50 BST, 21 September 2023 | Updated: 02:47 BST, 21 September 2023 An Australian schoolboy has returned to breakfast television after his extraordinary moment that aired on Australia's Today Show left the whole world in stitches. Byron Kirk, 10, made another appearance on the breakfast show on Thursday morning to chat in the studio with co-hosts Karl Stefanovic and Sarah Abo about his recent viral gag, before telling another off-colour vegan joke. This time, the youngster also took a swipe at fans of the Collingwood football club. 'Why are all Collingwood supporters vegans?' he asked. 'I don't know,' Stefanovic said. Kirk replied: 'Because you need teeth to chew meat!' The joke left the co-hosts stunned once again, as Abo jokingly scolded the 10-year-old while Stefanovic cried: 'Booyah!' Earlier on in the chat, Kirk's mother Melissa revealed the initial viral joke wasn't planned when he appeared on the show via Zoom link 'I kind of stirred him up beforehand. It was like, "Loosen up, tell a joke." And then before he went on live, I was like, "Don't tell a joke."' she explained. 'And then as soon as you asked for one and it went, I just said, I tried to make it not happen!' Kirk, who lives in the mining town of Mount Isa in outback Queensland, also revealed that while he doesn't have social media, his friends had come across the video 'every single day'. Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, Kirk spoke more about his rise to viral fame that culminated in an interview with TV host Piers Morgan. He said his chat with the polarising British presenter went well, as they shared the view that anyone who was offended 'needs to learn to laugh'. 'Mum kept telling me he's a really really big person,' Byron said. 'He didn't ask me any hard questions but we were on the same page.' Kirk's joke first aired on the Today show as Byron was talking about his experience of competing in the 2023 Youth Bull Riders World Finals in Texas. Having discussed the rodeo, Kirk thought he would chime in with a joke.

The 32-year-old man took to the popular Reddit forum “Am I The A**Hole,” where he asked fellow users if they felt he was in the wrong. Since it was posted last week, his viral post has received more than 7,900 comments from users debating his actions. The Redditor began by explaining how he and his wife, 33, have been married for eight years and share a 12-year-old son. When their child was around six years old, his wife decided she wanted to be vegan. “She was sent the documentary Dominion by a vegan friend of hers, and ever since [she] has said non-vegan food is ‘revolting’ and refuses to eat it,” he wrote. “After a long conversation, I agreed to go vegetarian and be vegan in the house and around her, which she was happy with.” After speaking to a dietician, both parents ultimately decided that their son should follow the vegan diet as well. Up until a few months ago, their food restrictions didn’t appear to be an issue. “Things have been fine with this arrangement, until a few months ago when I began finding wrappers from non-vegan candy and even burgers from McDonald’s in my sons school bag, which he had been buying with chore money,” the father said. “I had a conversation with my son and he confessed he felt lonely and excluded eating vegan around his friends, and that they always had much better candy than he did and it wasn’t fair,” he continued. Upon hearing his child’s woe, the father decided he didn’t want his son to spend money on snacks, let alone waste his vegan school lunch. The Reddit user wrote: “I decided I didn’t want him spending his pocket money on snacks and throwing out the vegan snacks we actually brought him instead of buying games etc, it made no sense.” “But I also know the way my wife feels about non-vegan products,” he went on. “So, I began buying my son what he wanted on our way to football practice instead.” Eventually, his wife discovered what he had been doing and “flipped out.” “She called me an animal abuse enabler and a few other names and said I was corrupting our son,” the man wrote. “Now she is not speaking to me, our son panicked and told her I had bought the snacks for him and he didn’t know they weren’t vegan.” However, the Redditor said he wasn’t upset with his son for exposing him, writing: “I don’t blame him for that.” Many Reddit users flocked to his viral post, where a majority of commenters seemingly supported the man’s efforts to buy his son non-vegan food. “I think we’re also forgetting this is a 12 year old boy. Anybody who has spent time around a growing boy knows that they eat nonstop, literally they can eat an entire roasted chicken in a day and still be looking for food,” one person commented. Another added: “I think the issue is that, while it’s possible to get all the nutrients being vegan, it takes significantly more effort to get it, and just like everyone else, decreasing nutrient density does not help.” “I don’t know any doctor that would suggest a vegan diet to anyone. It’s hard to get everything you need. I really don’t know one that would say that it’s a good idea for a kid at that,” one user remarked. “Forcing a vegan diet on your child is child neglect in Germany and therefore you can face serious legal consequences,” someone else claimed. Meanwhile, one vegan person agreed that the father was not in the wrong for giving his son non-vegan food. “We humans are designed to eat meat - it’s a perfectly normal thing for our bodies to do. In fact, I’m the abnormal one NOT eating meat,” they wrote. “I’m old enough to have made that choice and I’m happy - your son shouldn’t have it ‘forced’ upon him at such a young age, when building bonds is so important.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And now the singer is set to continue that trend with a tour of the U.S. this fall. As pointed out by Brooklyn Vegan, Ferreira’s long-awaited second album Masochism is still without a release date. But this new slew of shows will find her hitting venues in California, Texas, Illinois, New York, and more. Sat Nov 25 Pomona, CA The Glass HouseWed Nov 29 Dallas, TX TreesThu Nov 30 Austin, TX Emo’sSun Dec 3 Atlanta, GA The Masquerade – HeavenMon Dec 4 Madison, TN Eastside BowlWed Dec 6 Chicago, IL MetroThu Dec 7 Detroit, MI Majestic TheatreSat Dec 9 Philadelphia, PA Theatre of Living ArtsSun Dec 10 Boston, MA Paradise Rock ClubMon Dec 11 New York, NY Webster Hall Stay tuned to her Instagram page for ticket information and more dates to be announced. Nylon reported earlier this year that fans have started the #FreeSkyFerreira movement after they closely followed the delays the singer-songwriter has experienced with releasing new music. The report includes how a fan named Alex started this movement on Instagram in March 2021. It began after the artist responded to a comment on her page stating that Capitol Records were very aware that fans are eager for new music but “refused to acknowledge it.” In August, Stereogum reported that fans paid for a digital “Free Sky Ferreira” billboard in New York City’s Times Square. Ferreira reposted The Fader’s Instagram reel with the billboard saying, “It’s true.” She also reached out to the fans who run the Free Sky Ferreira Instagram page, saying, “thank you for your support & trying to help get what happened across.” Ferreira has released a total of two singles ahead of Masochism, “Downhill Lullaby” in 2019 and “Don’t Forget” in 2022. As quoted from her Instagram post shared by Stereogum, she addressed the delays saying, “This is not my fault & it’s not a conspiracy or whatever, I am in a DIFFICULT situation & I have to be ‘difficult’ to get through it. I have to protect my work & myself somehow? A lot of it is not being allowed to say or do anything I want/need without it being dismissed.” A post shared by Free Sky Ferreira (@free.skyferreira) Only members can comment. Become a member.

But the Fearless Fund is a tiny player in the approximately $200 billion global venture capital market. The Atlanta-based firm has invested nearly $27 million in some 40 businesses led by women of color since launching in 2019, and awarded another $3.7 million in grants. Collectively, those businesses employ about 540 people, up from 250 at the time of investment, according to the Fearless Fund’s “impact report,” released Wednesday.

Don't have an account? Create Account While the money has made a big difference to those businesses, Fearless Fund co-founder Arian Simone said it’s a drop in the bucket compared to systemic changes needed to close the racial and gender gap in venture capital funding. Less than 1% of venture capital funding goes to businesses owned by Black and Hispanic women, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Digitalundivided. Just to get that number over 2% would take billions of dollars, Simone said. “It takes trillions of dollars to really move the needle,” Simone said in an interview with The Associated Press, “which is why I think that policy changes need to take place in order to collectively get us up to speed.” Simone said she would like to see pension funds and other institutional investors, for example, enact mandates for venture capital firms to fund a certain number of minority-owned companies. It’s those sort of intentional policies that are under attack from conservative activist groups waging a legal battle against corporate diversity initiatives, an effort that has intensified since the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions. The lawsuit against the Fearless Fund was filed by Edward Blum, the conservative activist who filed the affirmative action cases before the Supreme Court. It targets the fund’s Strivers Grant Contest, which awards $20,000 to Black women who run businesses, arguing it violates a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibiting racial discrimination in contracts. Blum’s organization, American Alliance For Equal Rights, has also filed lawsuits against two law firms in Texas and Florida over fellowship programs for diverse candidates, accusing them of being discriminatory. In an interview with The AP, Blum said his organization brought the case against the Fearless Fund after another woman-owned business brought the grant contest to their attention. “A useful way of determining the fairness and ultimately the legality of a policy is to apply the shoe on the other foot test,” Blum said, asking whether “a different venture capital fund’s requirement that only white men are eligible for its funding and support” would be considered legal. The Fearless Fund enlisted prominent civil rights lawyers, including Ben Crump, to defend against the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. In court filings, the attorneys have argued that Blum’s group has no standing because it represents three anonymous women who never applied for funding from the Fearless Fund. They also argue that the grants are not contracts but donations protected by the First Amendment. Meanwhile, Simone said the Fearless Fund continues to get thousands of applications for its programs each week, illustrating the untapped potential of investing in women of color. The companies in its portfolio have found success in mainstream retail companies seeking to reach younger and more diverse customers. JCPenney CEO Marc Rosen said its partnership with Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce platform that promotes beauty brands created by people of color, is a cornerstone of its strategy revive its beauty business, which suffered a blow after Sephora left the chain to rival Kohl’s three years ago. Rosen said people of color account for a third of JCPenny’s customer base. “They’re going for products and brands that resonate with them and make them feel at home that are designed for them,” Rosen in a recent interview with The AP. Fearless Fund has invested more than $2 million in Thirteen Lune, founded by Nyako Griego. But overall funding for businesses owned by women of color has declined after experiencing a surge in the months after the racial protest that followed the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. The combined share of venture capital funding received by Black and Latina founders briefly surpassed 1% in 2021 before dipping back below that threshold in 2022, according to Digitalundivided. After Floyd’s killing, Simone said the Fearless Fund, whose backers include J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America and Mastercard, began receiving unsolicited investor interest for the first time. But that trend has since largely reversed. “That was a small window of time,” Simone said. “Everybody was looking for the Fearless Fund.” Associated Press Retail Writers Anne D’Innocenzio and Haleluya Hadero contributed to this story.

Create Account While the money has made a big difference to those businesses, Fearless Fund co-founder Arian Simone said it’s a drop in the bucket compared to systemic changes needed to close the racial and gender gap in venture capital funding. Less than 1% of venture capital funding goes to businesses owned by Black and Hispanic women, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Digitalundivided. Just to get that number over 2% would take billions of dollars, Simone said. “It takes trillions of dollars to really move the needle,” Simone said in an interview with The Associated Press, “which is why I think that policy changes need to take place in order to collectively get us up to speed.” Simone said she would like to see pension funds and other institutional investors, for example, enact mandates for venture capital firms to fund a certain number of minority-owned companies. It’s those sort of intentional policies that are under attack from conservative activist groups waging a legal battle against corporate diversity initiatives, an effort that has intensified since the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions.

Please try again The lawsuit against the Fearless Fund was filed by Edward Blum, the conservative activist who filed the affirmative action cases before the Supreme Court. It targets the fund’s Strivers Grant Contest, which awards $20,000 to Black women who run businesses, arguing it violates a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibiting racial discrimination in contracts. Blum’s organization, American Alliance For Equal Rights, has also filed lawsuits against two law firms in Texas and Florida over fellowship programs for diverse candidates, accusing them of being discriminatory. In an interview with The AP, Blum said his organization brought the case against the Fearless Fund after another woman-owned business brought the grant contest to their attention. “A useful way of determining the fairness and ultimately the legality of a policy is to apply the shoe on the other foot test,” Blum said, asking whether “a different venture capital fund’s requirement that only white men are eligible for its funding and support” would be considered legal. The Fearless Fund enlisted prominent civil rights lawyers, including Ben Crump, to defend against the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. In court filings, the attorneys have argued that Blum’s group has no standing because it represents three anonymous women who never applied for funding from the Fearless Fund. They also argue that the grants are not contracts but donations protected by the First Amendment. Meanwhile, Simone said the Fearless Fund continues to get thousands of applications for its programs each week, illustrating the untapped potential of investing in women of color. The companies in its portfolio have found success in mainstream retail companies seeking to reach younger and more diverse customers. JCPenney CEO Marc Rosen said its partnership with Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce platform that promotes beauty brands created by people of color, is a cornerstone of its strategy revive its beauty business, which suffered a blow after Sephora left the chain to rival Kohl’s three years ago. Rosen said people of color account for a third of JCPenny’s customer base. “They’re going for products and brands that resonate with them and make them feel at home that are designed for them,” Rosen in a recent interview with The AP. Fearless Fund has invested more than $2 million in Thirteen Lune, founded by Nyako Griego. But overall funding for businesses owned by women of color has declined after experiencing a surge in the months after the racial protest that followed the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. The combined share of venture capital funding received by Black and Latina founders briefly surpassed 1% in 2021 before dipping back below that threshold in 2022, according to Digitalundivided. After Floyd’s killing, Simone said the Fearless Fund, whose backers include J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America and Mastercard, began receiving unsolicited investor interest for the first time. But that trend has since largely reversed. “That was a small window of time,” Simone said. “Everybody was looking for the Fearless Fund.” Associated Press Retail Writers Anne D’Innocenzio and Haleluya Hadero contributed to this story.

2023-09-20	13:05:11+00:00		How about some 3D-printed vegan salmon?	https://boingboing.net/2023/09/20/how-about-some-3d-printed-vegan-salmon.html	A 3D-printed vegan version of a salmon filet is now on the market in Austria. It's created by the food tech startup Revo Foods, which calls it THE FILET. An article on IFL Science (link here) states that it "is thought to be the first 3D-printed food to reach supermarket shelves." Like some other meat replacement products, the salmon alternative is made from mycoprotein, which comes from filamentous fungi. As for its nutrition, the product contains a range of vitamins and – like its animal counterpart – omega-3 fatty acids. It's also considered to be high in protein, at 9.5 grams per 100 grams, although this is still less than the protein content in the same amount of normal salmon. Lab created meat substitutes, whether plant-based like this salmon-like product, or cell-cultivated "meat" made from animal cells, are hoped to reduce the tremendous environmental impact of the meat industry. This video from Revo Foods shows THE FILET being made, cooked and enjoyed by young, attractive actors. Even this promotional video didn't make the product look especially delicious to me, but hopefully it tastes better than it looks. And hopefully this is just the start of what Revo calls a "creative food revolution."

Or, judging by the press Nine’s breakfast show Today is getting, maybe do work with children! Especially un-PC ones. On yesterday’s show, hosts Karl Stefanovic and Sarah Abo were interviewing a young Aussie lad who’d just returned from the US competing in a rodeo tournament. Proving he’s as quick on a horse as he is with his tongue, the youngster decided to tell a joke to the hosts which could’ve got everyone it lot more trouble had it not been told by a cute little country lad. The youngster began by posing the question: “A vegan and a vegetarian are jumping off a cliff to see who will hit the bottom first. Who wins?” To which Stefanovic replied, “I don’t know.” Abo then enquired: “Who Wins?” The boy then delivered the answer as cool as a cumber: “Society!” Mercifully, the stunned hosts managed to diffuse the whole thing by rolling about on the floor. A Nine spokesperson told B&T it had not received any backlash to the segment from viewers who have chosen a meat-free lifestyle. The video has now been seen by millions of people around the globe after it was posted to Today’s TikTok account. American TV host Benny Johnson called it “the single greatest moment in television history”. Meanwhile someone else commented saying: “The joke of the century”. And even the vegetarians seemed divided on the joke. One person tweeted: “As a vegetarian, I laughed my arse off.” Another said: “As a vegetarian I approve.” “The Today Show is so unhinged, I love it,” another fan commented. However, it also managed to put some noses out of joint. “Society wins when animals are killed?” wrote one. Another said: “Such a great job of raising your kids, NOT, the joke is funny but this is how morals and compassion die.”

We've received your submission. A young boy’s joke about vegans stunned Australian TV viewers when it aired live on a national talk show. “Australia Today” hosts Karl Stefanovic and Sarah Abo were interviewing the boy, who was wearing a cowboy hat, when he told his joke. “A vegan and a vegetarian are jumping off a cliff to see who will hit the bottom first. Who wins?” he asked. “I don’t know,” Stefanovic said, while Abo replied: “Who wins?” “Society!” the boy exclaimed. The two hosts broke out in gales of laughter and Stefanovic doubled over in joy at the boy’s cheekiness, falling off his chair while holding his head in his hands. “We weren’t expecting that!” Abo said. The video has since gone viral after it was posted on the show’s TikTok account. The joke, which has generated a variety of positive and negative responses, was labeled onscreen as “The Best Vegan Joke.” “Such a great job of raising your kids, NOT, the joke is funny but this is how morals and compassion die,” one critic wrote. A second added: “Society wins when animals are killed?” Others found the humor in it, however, with one viewer calling it “the joke of the century.” “As a vegetarian I approve,” a second wrote, while a third admitted they “laughed my a–s off.”

We've received your submission. The tech mogul who spends $2 million a year on a strict regimen he insists bio-hacks his body into regaining its youth is a far cry from his former, chronically depressed self who used to wolf down trays of brownies in an effort to feel better. Bryan Johnson told an audience at RAADfest 2023 — the Revolution Against Aging and Death conference — earlier this month that at the height of his stress, “the only thing that would bring me relief was thinking about those brownies in the refrigerator, or leftover cookies,” according to Insider. “Every night at 7 p.m., the stresses of the day would just be on my shoulder, and it felt really heavy,” the 45-year-old millionaire said. “It was like this idea that if I could somehow get my hands on this food, I would have this momentary relief of this pain of my existence.” Johnson nicknamed this nighttime-snacking version of himself “Evening Bryan,” which he said routinely made an appearance at 7 p.m. nightly. “I would know full well like, ‘Oh God, he’s here again. We’re going to down a whole pan of brownies,'” Johnson said at the conference, per Insider. “One night, I just kind of jokingly said: ‘Evening Bryan, you make my life miserable. You’re fired.'” During this time, Johnson was in his 30s and said he was battling “chronic depression,” fathering “three little babies” and working on building the mobile payment startup Braintree, which was purchased by eBay in an $800 million cash deal in 2013. Johnson also recounted this time in a blog post titled “Sleep and Impulse Control” in 2021, where he described one night when the clock struck 7 p.m. “A freshly baked sugar cookie stares back at me. The doughy middle revealing itself in seductive allure. The sugar formed in what looks like a smile, taunting me,” he penned, noting that because of his over 95% “likelihood of failure” in caving to temptation, “there were 50lbs more of me in the world.” Also in 2021, Johnson has drastically reversed his poor habits, ditching his 7 p.m. dessert binge for a vegan dinner at 11 a.m. Johnson’s ultra-strict diet totals 2,250 calories per day, which he combines with a one-hour-long exercise regimen, 111 supplements daily, and going to bed at the same time each night in order to achieve an 18-year-old physique. Before bedtime, Johnson wears glasses that block blue light for two hours. He also constantly monitors his vital signs and undergoes monthly medical procedures to maintain his results, including ultrasounds, MRIs, colonoscopies, and blood tests. And while sleeping, Johnson is hooked up to a machine that counts the number of nighttime erections. He also takes daily measurements of his weight, body mass index, body fat, blood glucose levels, and heart rate variations. It’s all part of his anti-aging Project Blueprint, which he claims has given him an “atypical relationship with time” and costs upwards of $2 million per year. In May, Johnson took the project to another level when he enlisted his 17-year-old son, Talmage, to be his personal “blood boy” by providing transfusions in an hours-long process whereby plasma is fed directly into the dad’s veins. During the plasma swap, Johnson, his son, and his 70-year-old dad, Richard, had one liter of blood drained. Talmage’s plasma was fed into Johnson’s veins and Jonson’s plasma was fed into Richard’s veins. In the weeks since the the treatment, Johnson said that there were “no benefits detected” from the blood swap, and therefore he won’t be doing it again.

Co-hosts Karl Stefanovic and Sarah Abo were left visibly stunned when a schoolboy told an inappropriate joke about vegans falling to their deaths. After their initial shock subsided, the pair doubled over in laughter, while newsreader Brooke Boney covered her mouth in disbelief. Daily Mail Australia understands the moment was unplanned and producers had no idea what the boy was going to say ahead of time. The youngster began by asking: 'A vegan and a vegetarian are jumping off a cliff to see who will hit the bottom first. Who wins?' 'I don't know,' Stefanovic said. 'Who wins?' asked Abo. The boy didn't miss a beat as he replied: 'Society!' Stefanovic was so astounded he almost fell off the couch. 'We weren't expecting that!' Abo said, laughing nervously. The moment was later posted to the Today show's TikTok account - and soon drew millions of views from across Australia and around the world. The clip is making big waves in the United States, with TikTok users remarking that such a moment could never happen on strait-laced American TV.

'I'm not even this kid's dad, and he still made me proud!' a third wrote, while a fourth remarked: 'That kid just won the internet.' Many vegans and vegetarians were even forced to admit that, despite being the butt of the joke, the young man's comic timing was exemplary. 'As a vegetarian, I laughed my arse off,' one wrote.

2023-09-18	13:53:51+00:00		Find vegan, Mediterranean options in Cedar City next door to popular barbecue restaurant	https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2023/09/18/hws-find-vegan-mediterranean-options-in-cedar-city-next-door-to-popular-barbecue-restaurant/	CEDAR CITY — Anyone who has uttered words like hummus, falafel or tzatziki in Iron County knows the look. Some stare bewildered and ask what language is that, or worse. Others associate them with similar healthy foods, like tofu. In truth, Mediterranean foods such as these have for centuries used plant-based protein in diets with flavorful recipes in parts of the world where meat is not so plentiful. So the last place many would think to find a healthy hummus bowl is at a restaurant named Pork Belly’s Eatery and Catering Co. While one might not find such foods there, Chris P. Bacon’s vegan girlfriend opened a new type of eatery next door. When Kate and Eddie Meek moved to Cedar City more than eight years ago, they brought with them more than two decades of experience in the restaurant industry. They started their first restaurant in Southern Utah featuring barbecued meats, chicken bombs, island tacos and funeral potatoes, among similar hearty dishes. Next door, they are now offering food with a Mediterranean twist. The new store, 565 Hummus, sits next door to the barbecue restaurant on Main Street after the cell phone carrier that previously occupied the building left. “We needed the space to expand our catering business and our landlords are really great,” Kate Meek told Cedar City News. “After we remodeled and got some new equipment and flooring, there was some extra space up front. I have always wanted to do this.” By “this,” she means dishing out food that could be considered different to most palettes in Southern Utah. “There is nothing like this in Cedar City,” she said. “My two youngest daughters are Greek and I have always loved the food we share together. It’s basic. It’s healthy. It’s fresh — raw ingredients. I get the Mediterranean seasonings locally from The Drunken Butcher.” For those wondering about falafel? There was nothing awful about it, at least when taste-tested for the first time by this Cedar City News reporter. “It is ground-up chickpeas with different spices and herbs — and then it’s deep-fried,” Meek said. “It is a protein option for vegan and vegetarian.” The hummus bowls are served much like a salad, with a choice from three different types of hummus spread on the bottom, several options for greens and toppings, such as quinoa and pickled onions, then topped with tzatziki sauce and one choice of protein. For those wanting traditional portions, chicken, beef and lamb are also protein options for flatbreads and gyros that are available, along with the bowls. “We make our own tzatziki sauce and we marinate the tomatoes here. We eventually want to bring in some traditional Greek soups,” she said. “We wanted to bring healthier options.” For the last two months, business has been growing as word has spread around town. “We just put out that we are hiring,” Meek said. “I have several clients that come two times a week and they tell me how much better they feel. That is exciting, you’re not getting the grease and fatty content like eating fast food. Even the falafel is air-fried.” While Eddie Meek was a bit reticent about the idea of opening this type of restaurant, they happened upon a similar establishment in Las Vegas not long before opening the new place. After seeing him squeamishly look at the menu, Kate Meek finally had to order for him. “He wasn’t going to order,” she said. “I ordered the hummus bowl for him. And he’ll admit it now, it was one of the best things he’s ever had.” 565 Hummus can be found at 565 S. Main Street in Cedar City and is currently open Wednesday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. As demand increases, so will the hours of operation, she said.

The British label is popular amongst his fellow A-listers as well as royalty, including Ben Affleck, Eva Longoria, Meghan Markle and Princess Eugenie. Leo first threw his support behind the company in October last year saying at the time: 'I am proud to be an investor in LØCI, a brand dedicated to minimising its environmental impact, and centred around creating cruelty-free, ethical footwear.' LØCI's sneakers come in numerous colours and designs, but are not cheap and cost on average of £200 a pair. The brand boasts about 'ethical fashion without sacrificing on style' and uses 'premium repurposed ocean and land plastic', which was no doubt a draw for climate activist Leo. Pricey: LØCI's stylish footwear, which boast numerous colours and styles, are not cheap and cost on average £200 a pair 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and unisex, LØCI sneakers are handmade in Porto, Portugal using recycled ocean plastics, as well as renewable and biodegradable materials where possible to help deliver a stylish eco-conscious sneaker. Production is scaled up or down in response to demand to manage environmental impact. 10% of online profits on every pair purchased are donated to conservation charities focused on protecting wildlife. James Blunt's aristocrat wife Sofia has also designed a range for the label which benefited the Blue Marine Foundation. Earlier this year Titanic star Leo risked accusations of eco-hypocrisy as he was seen leaving Porto Cervo, Sardinia via a private airport. The actor who is a noted climate activist, boarded a plane at Olbia Private Airport which has its own private jet terminal for wealthy travellers. It comes as he has travelled between the US and cities such as London, Milan, and Paris over recent months - accumulating over 12,000 miles of travel. Leo has previously come under fire for his use of gas-guzzling private jets. In 2016, he was ridiculed for an 8,000 mile trip via private jet from Europe to New York City to accept an award for his environmental activism. Carbon emissions for private jets vary, but by some accounts are more than 37 times higher than flying commercial. It comes after the actor has been at the centre of a controversy - following his public kiss with Italian model Vittoria Ceretti, 25, in Ibiza earlier this month. And The Hollywood star has received some backlash on Twitter for dating yet another younger model. The Revenant sensation was seen in a passionate clinch with his new flame Vittoria during a recent visit to Hi Ibiza nightclub on the Spanish party island. He has a reputation for only dating women 25 or under and famously tends to break up with them after they pass the milestone - as he did with his last serious girlfriend Camila Morrone, now 26. After the pictures emerged with Vittoria, many were quick to ridicule him for the fact it wouldn't be a long relationship as she will turn 26 next June. One wrote: 'She gonna be gone before this tweet is done,' while another joked: 'One more year and he won't look at her again.' Leonardo and Vittoria, who have a 23 year age gap, were spotted gazing lovingly into each others eyes before they locked lips while partying at the venue until 4:30am.

Pricey: LØCI's stylish footwear, which boast numerous colours and styles, are not cheap and cost on average £200 a pair 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and unisex, LØCI sneakers are handmade in Porto, Portugal using recycled ocean plastics, as well as renewable and biodegradable materials where possible to help deliver a stylish eco-conscious sneaker. Production is scaled up or down in response to demand to manage environmental impact. 10% of online profits on every pair purchased are donated to conservation charities focused on protecting wildlife. James Blunt's aristocrat wife Sofia has also designed a range for the label which benefited the Blue Marine Foundation. Earlier this year Titanic star Leo risked accusations of eco-hypocrisy as he was seen leaving Porto Cervo, Sardinia via a private airport. The actor who is a noted climate activist, boarded a plane at Olbia Private Airport which has its own private jet terminal for wealthy travellers. It comes as he has travelled between the US and cities such as London, Milan, and Paris over recent months - accumulating over 12,000 miles of travel. Leo has previously come under fire for his use of gas-guzzling private jets. In 2016, he was ridiculed for an 8,000 mile trip via private jet from Europe to New York City to accept an award for his environmental activism. Carbon emissions for private jets vary, but by some accounts are more than 37 times higher than flying commercial. It comes after the actor has been at the centre of a controversy - following his public kiss with Italian model Vittoria Ceretti, 25, in Ibiza earlier this month. And The Hollywood star has received some backlash on Twitter for dating yet another younger model. The Revenant sensation was seen in a passionate clinch with his new flame Vittoria during a recent visit to Hi Ibiza nightclub on the Spanish party island. He has a reputation for only dating women 25 or under and famously tends to break up with them after they pass the milestone - as he did with his last serious girlfriend Camila Morrone, now 26. After the pictures emerged with Vittoria, many were quick to ridicule him for the fact it wouldn't be a long relationship as she will turn 26 next June. One wrote: 'She gonna be gone before this tweet is done,' while another joked: 'One more year and he won't look at her again.' Leonardo and Vittoria, who have a 23 year age gap, were spotted gazing lovingly into each others eyes before they locked lips while partying at the venue until 4:30am.

The traditional dishes are notoriously anti-vegan; roast turkey, pigs in blankets, and chocolate roulade to name but a few. Unsurprisingly, this leaves plant-based guests feeling somewhat apprehensive when sitting down at the table for Christmas dinner. But, the tides are slowly changing and supermarkets are stocking their shelves with more free-from products each year. This is all well and good for meal times, but what about advent calendars? Arguably the most exciting Christmas edible there is, advent calendars have traditionally been rolled out by names such as Cadbury and Lindt, who are yet to supply vegan alternatives. This means vegan shoppers need to look elsewhere. Household names such as Pip & Nut, H!P and Hotel Chocolat have all produced delicious vegan advent calendars to consider where dark chocolate snacks, cocoa-dusted truffles and milkless figurines wait behind closed doors to be unearthed.

Matcha teas, peanut butter cups and blood orange gummies make for flavoursome picks that are kind on the planet too.

Non-edible advent calendars offer the most thoughtful touch for your loved ones. They tend to be a tad more expensive but bear in mind that many are reusable and can be enjoyed for years to come. Plus, they are vegan by default. Gemstone treasure troves, colouring-in kits or empty pockets to fill with your own surprises require no dairy dramas. You can find more tempting picks here.

Laura Corbett, the owner of the Gourmet Goat Farmer near the village of Avebury, Wiltshire, was horrified when she received a tip off that she was about to be targeted online. Until then, her popular larder and cafe, which specialises in goat meats and dairy products, had enjoyed glittering reviews from the public, but now, she was told, the vegans were circling. Ms Corbett was sent a post by two separate moles who had infiltrated a private Facebook group of 650 people called 'Vegan Wiltshire', where an activist called Ian Somerville had asked followers: 'Can we have some negative reviews of this place, please? There's no way an animal farm should be able to enjoy a five-star rating.' Mr Somerville appears to have form. His reviews on Facebook have also criticised a family farm in Swindon for claiming to love animals while 'eating their dismembered corpses', as well as demanding that a hotel in Hungerford publicly states it is 'against the annihilation of wildlife'. The Gourmet Goat Farmer, Wiltshire, was targeted by 'militant' vegan activists (stock) Just Stop Oil is plotting to target and recruit more than 500 students under plans to paralyse London , the Mail can reveal today Sensing what was about to follow, Ms Corbett decided to put the activists on the back foot by going public first, telling the farm's 3,000 followers on Facebook about the activists' plot and offering to meet them in person to give them a tour of her farm. 'I worry greatly for vegans and their long term health and would like to do anything I can to broaden their knowledge of farming,' she wrote. Her intervention, she later learnt, caused consternation among the activists in the group, who considered a leak inquiry to establish how their plans were exposed. Nonetheless, a torrent of negative reviews for the Gourmet Goat Farmer quickly followed on both Google and Facebook in an orchestrated attempt to wreck her business's reputation. The Countryside Alliance is now calling for the practice to be outlawed in legislation, by creating a new offence of 'false communications'. Gratifyingly for Ms Corbett, the tactics of the vegans spectacularly backfired when supporters rallied behind her and she has since received an influx of positive reviews, as well as a boost in sales. 'They chose the wrong person and the wrong business,' she said. 'What is fairly ironic about it is that I couldn't really be more friendly to animals, we are providing conservation grazing to animals.' She admitted it had still been an unnerving experience for her children, to whom explained the situation over dinner, but insisted that it was just one of many occupational hazards faced by modern farmers. Of the activists, she said: 'They're a minority and I pity them, because there's a world out there in the countryside that is beautiful and it requires animals in the lifecycle for wildlife, for worms, for soil health, for hedgerow management.' As yet, she has not been taken up on her offer to give the vegans a tour of the farm. Mo Metcalf-Fisher, director of external affairs at the Countryside Alliance, said the Government had so far resisted efforts to include malicious fake reviews as an amendment to the Online Safety Bill, but they were hoping for it to be addressed through the Digital, Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill. He said that businesses should be held to ransom by a 'militant fringe', adding: 'The public are massively rejecting these calls for compulsory, plant-based veganism. But the vast bulk of people on plant-based diets don't behave in this way. It's not an argument about veganism, it's about harassment and bullying online.' He added: 'It seems perverse that ideologically driven cranks can get away with posting false and malicious fake reviews with such ease, while the victims - legitimate business owners - are left to pick up the pieces and suffer the consequences.'
