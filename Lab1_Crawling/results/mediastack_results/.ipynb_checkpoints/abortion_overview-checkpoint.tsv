The staff member then repeats the response when the operator asks, “What exactly happened?” (RELATED: Swing State Dems Launch Bid To Enshrine Abortion In State Constitution) “Ok do you have any more information so I can update our crew that’s responding?” the operator presses. “So it’s basically bleeding from a difficult procedure,” the clinic worker says, specifying that the patient, who ended up in the hospital, was bleeding from her cervix. “There was a complicated procedure. They said bleeding.” Just last week at an abortion clinic in Dayton, a women suffered from bleeding due to complications in an abortion. Issue 1 would eviscerate key health and safety standards putting countless more women at risk. pic.twitter.com/YXyiOjsZsU — Protect Women Ohio (@ProtectWomenOH) November 1, 2023 Ohioans are preparing to vote on a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw restrictions on abortion before “fetal viability,” and allow abortion up to birth if the pregnancy is deemed dangerous to the health of the mother. Opponents of the proposal have argued that the amendment would strike down parental consent laws surrounding abortion, placing young women at risk of undergoing dangerous procedures without their parents’ knowledge. In August, Ohio voters rejected an attempt to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution. The measure would have raised the threshold from 50 percent to 60 percent, making it harder for pro-abortion activists to rally the support necessary to enshrine abortion in the state’s constitution. “Issue 1 will also increase the number of ‘self abortions’ by women at home, without the presence of any medical personnel, which can only result in even more 911 calls from frantic women from their homes,” Dayton Right to Life said in a press release.

2023-11-02	19:25:00+00:00		Tennessee & Idaho Are Using Cruel Attacks to Dismiss Lawsuits Against Their Abortion Bans	https://jezebel.com/tennessee-idaho-are-using-cruel-attacks-to-dismiss-la-1850986077	Attorneys general for Tennessee and Idaho both filed motions to dismiss abortion rights lawsuits brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights in their states this week. In both cases, their motions use cruel language and personal attacks against the plaintiffs—women who have been directly impacted by the states’ abortion bans and are seeking to clarify what circumstances fall under the narrow exception for medical emergencies that these bans claim to include. Tennessee’s motion, filed Wednesday, claims that plaintiff Nicole Blackmon—who says she suffered “physical and emotional torture” from being forced to carry a nonviable pregnancy for months—doesn’t have standing to sue because she’s since had her tubes tied. The state suggests this limits the chances that she’ll become pregnant and be personally impacted by the ban again and that it’s insufficient for her to “sue so ‘no one else’ will suffer.” Meanwhile, Idaho’s motion filed earlier this week claims the state ban is an attempt to prioritize “by all legal means, live childbirth over abortion,” regardless of fetal conditions that could be antithetical to life. Tennessee bans abortion beginning at conception with exceptions only for endangerment to the life of the pregnant person, to preserve their health, or if the fetus isn’t viable. Three women who were denied emergency abortion care and two doctors are suing to demand that the state clarify what is included under the umbrella of these narrow exceptions. Idaho also bans abortion beginning at conception with exceptions only for endangerment of the life of the pregnant person and rape and incest. Four women who were denied emergency abortion care, two doctors, and Idaho Academy of Family Physicians are suing the state, also demanding clarification for when emergency abortions are permitted under these exceptions. What we’re seeing from Tennessee and Idaho closely reflects the cruelty and callousness of other anti-abortion state attorneys general who have worked to throw out lawsuits challenging their bans—often enough, by leveling personal attacks at the plaintiffs. In July, lawyers for Texas fought another suit by the Center for Reproductive Rights, also to clarify an exception for threats to the pregnant person’s life, by making arguments similar to Tennessee’s. The state claimed that because some of the plaintiffs’ fertility had been jeopardized by pregnancy complications and being denied timely emergency abortion care, these women didn’t have standing to sue because it was less likely they’d become pregnant and need to seek abortion care again. One of the plaintiffs called this framing “infuriating” and “ironic,” adding, “Do they not realize the reason why I might not be able to get pregnant again is because of what happened to me as a result of the laws that they support?” Blackmon, who became pregnant in July 2022 shortly after Tennessee’s abortion ban took effect, initially saw her pregnancy as a “blessing” until, 15 weeks in, she learned her fetus suffered from omphalocele. This condition impedes the development of the fetus’ abdominal wall, resulting in organs growing outside the body. Blackmon’s doctors told her this was a lethal anomaly and continuing the pregnancy endangered her health. But despite Tennessee’s narrow exception for such emergencies, she was still denied abortion care. Now, in the wake of her tubal ligation procedure, Blackmon’s experience has been invalidated by Tennessee’s motion this week, which she accuses of “trying to pretend” that what she experienced “never happened.” Her statement continues, “No one should ever have to go through what I went through. Tennessee lawmakers put my life in danger with this abortion ban. My fellow plaintiffs and I are asking for the bare minimum—the right to basic health care during the many risky complications that arise during pregnancy.” The motion also references one of Blackmon’s co-plaintiffs, Allyson Phillips, who learned 18 weeks into her pregnancy that her unborn daughter was incompatible with life. The state points to Phillips’ similar motivations for joining the lawsuit to “prevent any other person” from sharing her experience, calling this insufficient grounds for a lawsuit. The state then invokes how Phillips is “now running for state office to change the abortion laws,” unsubtly suggesting her involvement in the suit is for political gain. On Tuesday, Idaho filed its own motion to dismiss a similar lawsuit. In addition to claiming that Idaho’s ban is designed to “prefer...live childbirth” even “in cases in which a physician believes that the child will die shortly after birth,” it states that, “The statutes simply do not allow for an abortion in situations in which an unborn child is ‘unlikely’ to survive after birth.” This language is deeply callous in the face of people who have been forced to carry nonviable pregnancies to term and suffer the heartbreak of birthing a newborn that dies hours or days later. “Idaho lawmakers put these women through the unthinkable and now the state wants them thrown out of court,” Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement this week. In April, Jennifer Adkins, the lead plaintiff in the Idaho suit, learned her fetus had Turner syndrome and other severe anomalies incompatible with life. She was still forced to travel to Oregon for emergency abortion care, and, fearing criminal penalties, her medical team couldn’t even help refer her to a provider. In a statement responding to Idaho’s motion this week, Adkins accused Idaho’s laws of “[putting] my life at risk and [compounding] my heartbreak,” as she grieved giving up a wanted pregnancy. “The humane response would be for Idaho officials to acknowledge the harm these laws are causing and to expand the exceptions in their abortion ban,” she said in a statement. “Instead, the attorney general is literally trying to dismiss me and the other women in this case. It’s degrading and insulting.”

Has the equation changed at all? Though not on the ballot, Glenn Youngkin hopes to rally Virginia Republicans to victory in state elections as he hopes to pass a 15-week abortion ban Voters are headed to the polls in two states where the “Dobbs Effect” will face its latest test. A year after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ended federal protections for abortion in Dobbs vs Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the issue of abortion is back on the ballot in two battleground states that will each play a major role in next year’s presidential election. In Ohio, voters will consider an amendment to the state constitution enshrining “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom” as a right of all Ohioans, allowing for some limits on the practice of abortion but generally protecting it from an all-out ban or severe restrictions. And in Virginia, the state’s Republican governor is rallying his party around a 15-week abortion ban, and encouraging a perception of the state House of Delegates and Senate as either a green light or a roadblock ahead of the implementation of that legislation. Republicans took the governor’s mansion and House of Delegates in 2021, leaving Democrats in control of just one corner of government. All eyes are on these two states in the political world for obvious reasons: the pair of states are two major battlegrounds for presidential elections, though Ohio has trended increasingly red in recent cycles. The elections also represent the first real test of the American electorate in terms of abortion views since last year’s midterm congressional elections, when Republicans saw their “red wave” evaporate into a defeat in the Senate and a razor-thin unruly House majority. While some in the beltway media sphere proclaimed that backlash from the Supreme Court’s spring decision tossing Roe v Wade’s precedent — the “Dobbs Effect” – would subside before the 2022 midterms, the clear reality was that voters who support abortion rights delivered major victories for both Democrats and the pro-choice movement specifically last year. The victories occurred in purple and red states as well as blue Democratic strongholds, signalling that the momentum was headed in the opposite direction of the hardline pro-life movement. This year, Republicans are hoping that the trend will reverse itself. In Ohio, where municipal races are the only ones on the ballot this year, the result will be a clear referendum on the issue, and Question 1 will be the largest factor drawing voters to the polls. Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin, who enjoys reasonably positive approval ratings, is not on the ballot either; and legislative priorities may take greater importance over the personalities of lesser-known candidates for state offices at the polls in the Old Dominion state. The question of what the “Dobbs Effect” will look like in Virginia is a particularly interesting one. Mr Youngkin, cognisant of the fact that Democrats and abortion rights maintain serious support bases in the state, has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars via his Spirit of Virginia PAC into sculpting the conversation around his proposed ban — which he insists should not be referred to as such. Ads are demanding that reporters refer to the proposal as a “reasonable limit” on abortion, noting exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies. It’s essentially an admission from Mr Youngkin and the state GOP that a “ban” is politically unpopular and would be rejected by voters in a purple state. At the same time, he has won praise from major anti-abortion groups, which suggests that they see his strategy as the path forward for their movement in such areas. A spokesman for Mr Youngkin’s PAC told The Washington Post last week that the reason Republicans were shellacked so handily in areas where abortion was on the ballot in 2022 came down to a lack of aggression from the GOP in response to criticism on the issue. “There was no Republican response, none, and the results were tough in the ’22 midterms,” Zack Roday told the Post. “Republicans didn’t talk about where they were. They didn’t swat back the misstatements, the sometimes outright lies.” That theory will be put to the test on Tuesday. If Mr Youngkin and the Virginia GOP eke out a victory, it could mean a major watershed moment for the anti-abortion movement — a meaningful election result it can point to when challenged on the popularity of its agenda. Should they lose ground in the state’s legislative branch, it will instead reinforce a different idea, one driven home in 2022: That the left controls the momentum on this issue; the latest front to turn against conservatives in the culture war.

2023-11-02	18:50:28+00:00	JULIE CARR SMYTH Associated Press	An Ohio amendment serves as a testing ground for statewide abortion fights expected in 2024	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/an-ohio-amendment-serves-as-a-testing-ground-for-statewide-abortion-fights-expected-in-2024/	COLUMBUS, Ohio | Abortion access is expected to play a central role in the 2024 elections. The preview comes next week, when Ohio voters decide whether to enshrine reproductive rights in their state Constitution. The amendment is the only abortion question on any state’s ballot this year, a spotlight that has generated intense attention from national groups and made Ohio a testing ground for fresh campaign messaging — some of it misleading. The amendment has drawn more than $60 million in combined spending so far. Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year’s presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Initiatives seeking to protect access could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. “When we’re able to see how our messaging impacts independents and Republicans and persuades them that this fundamental freedom is important to protect in Ohio, that’s going to be something that we can implement looking at 2024,” she said. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. The battleground on abortion shifted to the states last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, erasing federal abortion protections that had been in place for half a century. Since then, voters in six states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — have either supported measures protecting abortion rights or rejected efforts aimed at eroding access. Kelsey Pritchard, state public affairs director for the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said the outcomes in 2022 offered lessons that the anti-abortion movement has implemented in Ohio through more coalition-building and stronger messaging. Abortion opponents, she said, “will apply those weapons and learning in other states going forward.” Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose advanced ballot language for the Ohio amendment that its supporters said was misleading, while GOP Attorney General Dave Yost took the unconventional step of producing his own “legal analysis” of the amendment. Its supporters said those actions by top state officials could cost them votes. But like the anti-abortion movement itself, Ohio’s Republicans have not been in lockstep on the issue. The GOP-led Ohio Senate has used its website to spread misleading claims about the amendment even as Gov. Mike DeWine has made the rounds of TV stations pledging that his party will pass a reasonable alternative if voters defeat the measure. For the first time in his 46-year political career, DeWine now says he would support exceptions for rape and incest in any future abortion legislation if the measure fails. The governor has allied with the Ohio Catholic Conference, which is running a campaign through its churches to defeat the amendment, which is on the ballot as Issue 1. Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against it, also has generated support from some Black faith leaders. Supporters have answered with an ad featuring the senior minister of First Congregational Church in Columbus, who called abortion a private matter and said “government needs to stay out of family decision-making.” The Ohio amendment would guarantee an individual’s right “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” It expressly permits the state to regulate abortions after fetal viability, as determined by an attending physician, as long as any laws regulating the procedure after that point provide exceptions for the life and health of the woman. Its supporters include Democrats in the state, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and a bipartisan coalition of labor, faith and community groups. They portray the measure — one of the most broadly worded so far — as a way to enshrine Roe-era abortion rights in a one-time bellwether state that has turned increasingly Republican and has passed some of the nation’s toughest restrictions on the procedure. That includes a law currently held up by legal challenges that bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, before many women know they’re pregnant. That law makes no exceptions for rape or incest. “This is the most conservative state to date where we’re pushing for proactive state constitutional amendments,” said Carolyn Ehrlich, senior campaign strategist at the ACLU. Opponents, including state Republicans, the Center for Christian Virtue and Ohio Right to Life, say the amendment provides too much access to abortion and does so too late into pregnancy. They question whether state lawmakers could pass any abortion restrictions at all that would pass constitutional muster if voters approve the amendment. “This is more than just a pro-choice or pro-life statement,” said Megan Wold, a former deputy Ohio solicitor general working with Protect Women Ohio. “It is an up or down vote, but it’s an up or down vote on very particular language that’s going to have a real impact on the way that Ohio can regulate abortion in the future.” Protect Women Ohio’s interest in persuading independent and politically moderate voters is about the math, since public support for some form of abortion rights has remained well over the 50% mark in the U.S. for years. AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal. Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday. He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state “and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they’re going to reject it.” The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio’s was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. “I think there’s a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said. McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. “Ohio voters really know what’s at stake here, because they’ve seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people’s lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.” Fernando reported from Chicago.

2023-11-02	17:05:18+00:00		Senate sidesteps Tuberville’s hold and confirms new Navy head, first female on Joint Chiefs of Staff	https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/general-election/3257063/senate-sidesteps-tubervilles-hold-and-confirms-new-navy-head-first-female-on-joint-chiefs-of-staff.html	 Senate confirms three military officers as Sen. Tuberville holds up hundreds more WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate confirmed three top military officers on Thursday — including the first female member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — as bipartisan frustration swirled around Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville for blocking hundreds more nominees. Republican senators plan to hold a closed-door meeting next week to discuss the Alabama senator’s blockade of senior military nominees, which he has been waging over a Pentagon abortion policy. Republicans have tried, unsuccessfully, for almost nine months to quietly persuade Tuberville to drop the holds on almost 400 nominees. Senior military officials have warned repeatedly that the situation threatens readiness and national security. Anger over Tuberville’s tactic spilled out in the Senate on Wednesday evening, when a group of Republican senators held the floor for more than four hours and called up 61 of the nominations for votes, praising each nominee for their military service and challenging the Alabama senator to explain himself. Tuberville showed no signs of letting up, quietly standing and objecting to each one even as his colleagues lashed out at him. With Tuberville dug in, there are no easy answers on how to move forward. Republicans said they will continue to try and negotiate with him, hoping to persuade Tuberville to hold up civilian nominees instead, and said that they will also try to force more votes. Democrats want stronger action and are seeking to move forward with a resolution that would allow batches of military nominees to be passed over Tuberville’s objections. But that would need Republican support, and GOP senators are wary it could set a bad precedent that erodes the power of the minority in the Senate. Whatever the next steps, Tuberville’s Republican colleagues made clear that they are fed up. “It’s time to develop a new and smarter strategy,” said Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who served in the Marine Corps and was one of the senators who criticized Tuberville’s blockade on the Senate floor. The Senate on Thursday confirmed three of the nominees that Tuberville was holding up — Adm. Lisa Franchetti to lead the Navy, Gen. David Allvin to be chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force and Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney to serve as assistant commandant for the U.S. Marine Corps. Franchetti is the first woman to serve as a Pentagon service chief and hold a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday he was pleased that the Senate confirmed the three officers. But “we still have more than 370 superbly qualified leaders who have seen their nominations unnecessarily stalled,” he said. “As we face a variety of urgent challenges, the most powerful fighting force in history must be at full-strength.” Austin said the delay is hurting readiness and “unnecessarily weighed down our military families, who already give up so much to support those who serve.” Because of Tuberville’s holds and Senate procedure, confirmation of those three military officials took three days and six votes from start to finish — underscoring the difficulty majority Democrats have as they contemplate how to move hundreds of nominations. The Senate has traditionally approved large groups of military nominations by voice vote, but just one senator’s objection can upend that process. Republican Sens. Young and Joni Ernst of Iowa each suggested on Thursday that there would be an effort to try and convince Tuberville to hold up civilian nominations linked to the abortion policy instead of military officers who have nothing to do with it. “Why are we taking hostages that can’t change the policy?” Ernst said. But Tuberville said Wednesday there is “zero chance” he will drop the holds, which he first announced in February. Despite several high-level vacancies and the growing backlog, he has said he will continue to hold the nominees up unless the Pentagon ends — or puts to a vote in Congress — its new policy of paying for travel when a servicemember has to go out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care. President Joe Biden’s administration instituted the policy after the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, and some states have limited or banned the procedure. “I cannot simply sit idly by while the Biden administration injects politics in our military from the White House and spends taxpayers’ dollars on abortion,” Tuberville said Wednesday evening. Confronting Tuberville publicly for the first time since he announced the holds, the Republican senators, led by Ernst and Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, read lengthy biographies, praised the nominees and lashed out at Tuberville as they called for vote after vote. They said they agree with the Alabama senator in opposing the abortion policy but questioned — as Democrats have for months — why he would hold up the highest ranks of the U.S. military. As Wednesday night wore on, Sullivan, a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, and Ernst, a former commander in the U.S. Army Reserve and Iowa Army National Guard, appeared increasingly frustrated. Sullivan called the blockade a “national security suicide mission.” The GOP senators noted that they were bringing up the nominations “one by one” as Tuberville had once called for, and they asked why he wouldn’t allow them to go forward. Tuberville did not answer. “I do not respect men who do not honor their word,” Ernst said of her GOP colleague toward the end of the evening. The Senate voted to confirm the three top officers on Thursday after the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, was hospitalized Sunday after suffering a medical emergency at his official residence in Washington. Smith, who is listed in stable condition and is recovering, was confirmed to the top job last month, but he had been holding down two high-level posts for several months because of Tuberville’s holds. Mahoney, who was confirmed as assistant commandant, could step into the acting commandant role as Smith recovers. He is a fighter pilot who has flown combat in Iraq and served as the deputy commander of Marine forces in the Pacific. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said after Mahoney’s confirmation that the holds have placed significant stress on the military’s officers and families. “We have seen tragic effects to that stress,” Hicks said. “And I think that’s been well communicated on Capitol Hill.” When Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced the vote this week on Mahoney’s nomination to be assistant commandant, he said Smith’s sudden medical emergency is “precisely the kind of avoidable emergency that Sen. Tuberville has provoked through his reckless holds.” Also confirmed was Franchetti, who will lead the Navy. She is the second woman to be promoted to four-star admiral, and did multiple deployments, including as commander of a naval destroyer and two stints as aircraft carrier strike group commander. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., called Franchetti a “trailblazer.” Several women have served as military service secretaries as political appointees, but never as their top uniformed officer. Adm. Linda L. Fagan is the commandant of the Coast Guard, but she is not a member of the Joint Staff. Allvin is the vice chief of staff of the Air Force but has been serving as acting chief since the previous top Air Force officer, Gen. CQ Brown, became c hairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Oct. 1. Allvin is a career air mobility pilot with more than 4,600 flight hours and key deployments in Afghanistan and Europe.

We've received your submission. An 18-year-old Idaho boy and his mother have been arrested after police said the teen raped a 15-year-old girl who was then taken across state lines to get an abortion without her parents’ permission. Kadyn Swainston and his mother, Rachael Swainston, 42, from Pocatello, have been hit with a slew of felony counts stemming from a months-long investigation. The teenager was charged with second-degree kidnapping, rape and producing child sexually exploitive material, reported the Idaho State Journal. His mom was also charged with kidnapping, as well as trafficking in methamphetamine, possession of fentanyl and psychedelic mushrooms and harboring a wanted felon. The probe that culminated with the mother and son’s arrests last week was launched on June 18 when a woman contacted the Pocatello Police Department to report that her 15-year-old daughter had been raped by Kadyn and later driven to Bend, Oregon, for an abortion. But the alleged victim claimed during a forensic interview at a child advocacy center in August that her relationship with Kadyn was consensual. She said the two of them began having sex when the boy was 17 and continued after he turned 18, according to a police report. The girl told the interviewer that not long after Kadyn’s 18th birthday, she found she was expecting a baby and was “happy” about the pregnancy. Kadyn, however, was not pleased with the prospect of becoming a father and allegedly demanded that the girl terminate the pregnancy, or he would not pay child support and would break up with her. On May 18, Rachael Swainston rented a car and traveled with Kadyn and the 15-year-old pregnant girl to a clinic in neighboring Oregon, where the youngster obtained an abortion. Her mother told police she did not consent to the procedure. The incident took place just months after Idaho adopted the so-called “abortion trafficking” law that makes it illegal for an adult to help a minor get an abortion without parental consent. Idaho is one of 13 states that effectively ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy, and is one of a handful of states that have laws penalizing those who help people of any age obtain abortions. Notably, neither Kadyn Swainston nor his mother has been charged under the new “abortion trafficking” law. Police obtained search warrants for Kadyn’s and Rachael’s phone records, which confirmed that they traveled to Oregon on May 18. The 15-year-old girl also allowed investigators to comb through the contents of her phone, which turned up three photos and video that showed her and Kadyn engaging in sex acts, according to police. When interviewed by investigators, Kadyn allegedly admitted to having sex with the girl when he was 18 years old and she was 15, and then taking her to Oregon to get an abortion. Rachael also allegedly admitted to transporting the 15-year-old to Oregon to get an abortion, but she said both the girl and her son had agreed to it. She denied forcing the teenage girl to end her pregnancy. Police executed a search warrant on Oct. 26 at the Swainstons’ home, where they allegedly found methamphetamine in the mother’s bedroom. They also arrested a man who was staying in the family’s storage shed on an outstanding felony warrant related to meth trafficking. The mother and son are due back in court for a preliminary hearing on Nov. 7. If convicted of their top charges — meth trafficking for Rachael and rape for Kadyn — they could face up to life in prison.

Mr Tuberville has been blocking the confirmations of new military leaders citing his opposition to the Department of Defense’s policy of paying for troops needing abortions to travel out of state for reproductive health care services if they are stationed in areas where the procedures have become unavailable following the striking down of the Roe v Wade ruling by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2022. The blockade has made several top-level officers perform multiple jobs concurrently. GOP senators pushed on Wednesday night for the confirmation of more than 60 military nominees but Mr Tuberville refused to give in. The effort was headed by Sen Dan Sullivan of Alaska and he was backed up by Sens Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Todd Young of Indiana, and Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. They each requested votes on every officer by unanimous consent, a process which took hours, but Mr Tuberville was there to block all of them. “The Pentagon has issued a legal opinion I disagree with saying this doesn't violate the Hyde Amendment. I disagree with it,” Mr Graham said before directly addressing Mr Tuberville. “You just denied this lady a promotion,” he said, holding up an image of one of the military nominees. “All of us are ready to promote her because she deserves to be promoted. She had nothing to do with this policy. Let me say it again, everybody in this body could find an issue with any administration they don't agree with.” “What we’re gonna do is open up Pandora’s Box. Today is abortion policy. If we take back the White House, we’ll go back to the Mexico City policy limiting dollars to be given to overseas entities that are engaged in the abortion business, some pro-choice people don’t like that,” Mr Graham, a former member of the Air Force, added. “What would happen if they put a hold on all the officers because they don’t agree with the Republican administration? There’s a reason this has not been done this way for a couple hundred years ... this is doing great damage to our military.” “I’ve been trying to work with you for nine months,” Mr Graham told the Alabama senator. “Folks, if this keeps going, people are going to leave,” he told the chamber. “There [are] some people that are waiting to be promoted, that if they don’t get promoted soon, they’re gonna be out of the military,” Mr Graham noted. “How does that help anybody if they’re qualified?” “We have done the best that we can to honour the request of a fellow senator that these nominations be brought to the floor and voted on individually,” Ms Ernst said. “And I really respect men of their word. I do not respect men who do not honour their word. We have brought forward nearly 60 nominees. Every one of them [has] been denied.” “We're impacting readiness, and we're definitely impacting morale – And that's readiness,” Mr Sullivan said. “My colleague’s saying, ‘Oh, don't worry, there's no problem, no readiness problems’. No offence, but that's just ridiculous and he knows it – We all know it.” “I want the American people to know right now 376 promotions to one, two, three, and four-star generals and admirals are being held,” Mr Sullivan said. “It is estimated by the end of this year 89 per cent of all general officer positions in the United States military will be affected by the current holds from Senator Tuberville ... This is pretty much the entire officer corps. This is hugely disruptive to readiness.” Calling the blockade, “a national security suicide mission,” Mr Sullivan said that “the idea that some of these officers are supposedly woke or desk jockeys, it’s ridiculous,” according to Politico. “Hang in there,” Mr Sullivan said, addressing the officers affected by the blockade. “We’ll be coming here every night to try to get you confirmed.” The Alaska senator said on several occasions that Mr Tuberville had previously committed to voting on individual nominees but the Alabamian continued to demand that the Pentagon end the policy before he would allow any confirmations. “I have to respectfully disagree with my colleagues about the effect of my hold on readiness. My hold is not affecting readiness,” he claimed. Mr Romney argued that the hold was “an abuse of the powers we have as senators”. This comes after Gen Eric Smith was hospitalised on Sunday after reportedly suffering a heart attack during a jog, according to The New York Times. The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democratic Sen Jack Reed of Rhode Island, told Politico “One of the reasons I think contributed to his condition was he was doing two jobs at once”. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the press that “patience is wearing thin with Sen Tuberville on both sides of the aisle”. “What happened with the Marine commandant just showed many people how dangerous what Tuberville is doing is,” he added. In a statement to The Independent on Wednesday, Mr Tuberville’s Communications Director Steven Stafford said: “Coach is praying for a swift recovery for General Smith and he has gathered enough signatures on a cloture petition to force Senator Schumer to vote on confirming General Mahoney to be Assistant Commandant.” On Thursday morning, Mr Tuberville told reporters that the criticism he faced was “a little character assassination at times” but that he remains firm on his blockade. He again rejected the notion that his actions are affecting military readiness. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies U.S. Sen.

2023-11-02	09:41:05+00:00	Michael Gryboski                                                                                  02 November 2023 | 9:42 AM	Most Brits support banning pro-life protests outside abortion clinics: poll	https://www.christiantoday.com/article/most.brits.support.banning.pro.life.protests.outside.abortion.clinics.poll/140970.htm	(CP) A little over three-quarters of British citizens are in favour of banning pro-life protests outside abortion clinics, according to the recently released findings of a survey. According to a YouGov UKÂ poll released earlier this month, 77% of British citizens approve of banning protests that occur in the "immediate surroundings of abortion clinics," while 14% oppose banning them and 9% are not sure. Support for a ban on abortion clinic protests was slightly higher for women than men, with 81% of female respondents expressing support for a ban, versus 76% of male respondents. The poll found that 49% of respondents supported the current legal limit of allowing elective abortion up until 24 weeks into a pregnancy, with only 25% of respondents saying it should be pushed back to earlier into a pregnancy. On a related question, 65% of respondents said that they support allowing abortion for any reason for up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, with 16% saying it should only be available during that time for "specific circumstances, such as disability or risk to the health of the mother." The poll results were derivedÂ from a survey of 2,098 Britons conducted Sept. 28-29, with no margin of error listed. In recent times, there have been efforts in the United Kingdom to ban pro-life demonstrations and vigils held near abortion providers by creating buffer zones around clinics. Last December, the United Kingdom Supreme Court upheldÂ a law passed in Northern Ireland that prohibits demonstrations near abortion facilities, with the court arguing that "this restriction can be justified" as it "pursues a legitimate aim." "It seeks to ensure that women have access to advice and treatment related to the lawful termination of a pregnancy under conditions which respect their privacy and dignity and are not driven instead to less safe alternatives," wrote U.K. Supreme Court President Robert John Reed for the court. "It is also designed to enable staff who work at hospitals and clinics where terminations are available to attend their place of work without being intimidated, harassed, or abused." Activist Isabel Vaughan-Spruce faced a months-long legal battleÂ after she was arrested for silently praying outside an abortion clinic in Birmingham, England. In September, West Midlands Police announced that, following a six-month investigation, they would not bring chargesÂ against Vaughan-Spruce for her silent prayer. "The arduous process of this criminal ordeal has been the punishment for Isabel. Moreover, her story has put the world on notice that fundamental freedoms are vulnerable in the UK," said Jeremiah Igunnubole, legal counsel for the U.K. chapter of the Alliance Defending Freedom, who helped to represent Vaughan-Spruce, in a statement released in September. "There is now an urgent need for legal changes to stem the tide of policing by politics. We hope the decision from West Midlands Police that they will not prosecute free thought, alongside the Home Secretary's public commitment to protecting silent prayer, will be reflected in legislation, guidance, and practice."

2023-11-02	05:10:29+00:00	ABC News	Ohio amendment serves as test for statewide abortion fights expected in 2024	https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ohio-amendment-serves-testing-ground-statewide-abortion-fights-104564718	COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Abortion access is expected to play a central role in the 2024 elections. The preview comes next week, when Ohio voters decide whether to enshrine reproductive rights in their state Constitution. The amendment is the only abortion question on any state's ballot this year, a spotlight that has generated intense attention from national groups and made Ohio a testing ground for fresh campaign messaging — some of it misleading. The amendment has drawn more than $60 million in combined spending so far. Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year's presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Initiatives seeking to protect access could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. "When we’re able to see how our messaging impacts independents and Republicans and persuades them that this fundamental freedom is important to protect in Ohio, that’s going to be something that we can implement looking at 2024,” she said. The battleground on abortion shifted to the states last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, erasing federal abortion protections that had been in place for half a century. Since then, voters in six states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — have either supported measures protecting abortion rights or rejected efforts aimed at eroding access. Kelsey Pritchard, state public affairs director for the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said the outcomes in 2022 offered lessons that the anti-abortion movement has implemented in Ohio through more coalition-building and stronger messaging. Abortion opponents, she said, “will apply those weapons and learning in other states going forward.” Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose advanced ballot language for the Ohio amendment that its supporters said was misleading, while GOP Attorney General Dave Yost took the unconventional step of producing his own ”legal analysis" of the amendment. Its supporters said those actions by top state officials could cost them votes. But like the anti-abortion movement itself, Ohio’s Republicans have not been in lockstep on the issue. The GOP-led Ohio Senate has used its website to spread misleading claims about the amendment even as Gov. Mike DeWine has made the rounds of TV stations pledging that his party will pass a reasonable alternative if voters defeat the measure. For the first time in his 46-year political career, DeWine now says he would support exceptions for rape and incest in any future abortion legislation if the measure fails. The governor has allied with the Ohio Catholic Conference, which is running a campaign through its churches to defeat the amendment, which is on the ballot as Issue 1. Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against it, also has generated support from some Black faith leaders. Supporters have answered with an ad featuring the senior minister of First Congregational Church in Columbus, who called abortion a private matter and said “government needs to stay out of family decision-making.” The Ohio amendment would guarantee an individual’s right “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” It expressly permits the state to regulate abortions after fetal viability, as determined by an attending physician, as long as any laws regulating the procedure after that point provide exceptions for the life and health of the woman. Its supporters include Democrats in the state, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and a bipartisan coalition of labor, faith and community groups. They portray the measure — one of the most broadly worded so far — as a way to enshrine Roe-era abortion rights in a one-time bellwether state that has turned increasingly Republican and has passed some of the nation's toughest restrictions on the procedure. That includes a law currently held up by legal challenges that bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, before many women know they're pregnant. That law makes no exceptions for rape or incest. “This is the most conservative state to date where we’re pushing for proactive state constitutional amendments,” said Carolyn Ehrlich, senior campaign strategist at the ACLU. Opponents, including state Republicans, the Center for Christian Virtue and Ohio Right to Life, say the amendment provides too much access to abortion and does so too late into pregnancy. They question whether state lawmakers could pass any abortion restrictions at all that would pass constitutional muster if voters approve the amendment. “This is more than just a pro-choice or pro-life statement," said Megan Wold, a former deputy Ohio solicitor general working with Protect Women Ohio. “It is an up or down vote, but it’s an up or down vote on very particular language that’s going to have a real impact on the way that Ohio can regulate abortion in the future." Protect Women Ohio's interest in persuading independent and politically moderate voters is about the math, since public support for some form of abortion rights has remained well over the 50% mark in the U.S. for years. AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal. Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday. He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state "and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they're going to reject it.” The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio's was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. “I think there's a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said. McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. “Ohio voters really know what's at stake here, because they've seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people's lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.” Fernando reported from Chicago.

2023-11-02	04:59:36+00:00		Mother, son charged with kidnapping after police say they took a Pocatello teenager to Oregon for an abortion	https://www.cachevalleydaily.com/news/archive/2023/11/01/mother-son-charged-with-kidnapping-after-police-say-they-took-a-pocatello-teenager-to-oregon-for-an-abortion/	An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son’s minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl’s mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion. With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year. Idaho’s Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren’t relying on it. According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend’s house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho. The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant. According to court documents, the girl said she was “happy” when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship. The boyfriend’s mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to “kick her out of their house” if she did. The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles (885 km) from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl’s cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time. The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was “mutually agreed upon” between the girl and her son. She said she she never “coerced” anyone into having an abortion. Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl. The mother is also facing multiple drug charges. Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.” Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment.

AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal. Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday. He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state “and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they’re going to reject it.” The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio’s was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. “I think there’s a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said. McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. “Ohio voters really know what’s at stake here, because they’ve seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people’s lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.” Fernando reported from Chicago.

Kwazulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg Judge Nkosinathi Chili was also not convinced by Zuma's advocate Dali Mpofu's arguments that Downer and this writer must be ordered to appear in court when the private prosecution returns to court on 9 April 2024. Instead, the judge directed "that the parties will be represented by their respective legal representatives on the day."

It’s been a little over two months since South Carolina’s supreme court upheld a new abortion law banning the practice in almost all cases after six weeks. That decision – which effectively undid a previous ruling outlawing the six-week ban – was presumed to have been the last word on this hot-button issue in the Palmetto State for the foreseeable future. And many – if not most – occupying leadership positions within the S.C. General Assembly certainly hoped that would be the case. Was it? As I noted in an expansive treatment published just a week after the court’s recent ruling, abortion policy is continuing to generate significant heat among members of the S.C. General Assembly – and among those seeking to challenge them for their seats. “Republican” lawmakers who thought they’d dealt with the issue decisively already are now facing fresh criticism from staunch pro-lifers eager to see them go further – by banning abortion from the moment of conception. In Spartanburg County, for example, one incumbent senator who voted for the new six-week ban is being challenged to debate his position with a would-be rival who supports the broader ban – a challenge he appears willing to accept. Josh Kimbrell won his seat in the S.C. Senate in 2020 – ousting veteran Democrat Glenn Reese. Kimbrell is running for reelection in 2024 – possibly as a stepping stone to a gubernatorial campaign in 2026. In recent days, though, the aviation executive has found himself the focus of withering criticism from pro-life advocate Matt Brock. Brock is the executive director of Equal Protection South Carolina (EPSC), a group which exists for the purpose of “establishing justice for the pre-born.” “I believe babies in the womb, from the moment of fertilization are as equal in value as humans outside the womb,” Brock told me. “Therefore, I believe they are deserving of equal protection and equal justice under the law and are covered under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Brock has been challenging Kimbrell – whom he deems insufficiently conservative on the issue of abortion – to debate him on this issue. “In the spirit of integrity, transparency and consistency, I would like to publicly challenge my senator, Josh Kimbrell, to a public moderated debate,” Brock wrote on his Facebook page recently. “To put the odds even more in his favor, I’m happy to do it at HIS church with HIS pastor moderating.” Brock also offered to pay $1,000 to anyone willing to set up the debate. Will Kimbrell take Brock up on his challenge? According to a recent Facebook comment, the answer to that question would appear to be “yes.” “I’m the true conservative leader here and you’re a charlatan,” Kimbrell wrote in the Facebook comment. “You want a debate you better bring your A-game, bro.” As the two discussed potential moderators, times and venues for the debate, Kimbrell did introduce one caveat into the equation. “I’m doing this only if it’s not a con job by you,” he wrote. To recap: The authority of the state to regulate abortion has been firmly established by the U.S. supreme court’s recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had maintained a national right to abortion for the last half century. The overturning of Roe effectively legalized state abortion bans including the so-called “heartbeat bill” – which outlawed a majority of abortions in the Palmetto State once a fetal heartbeat had been detected. In January of this year, however, the state court struck down the heartbeat bill – specifically the six-week requirement of the law – after it was challenged by the South Atlantic office of national abortion provider Planned Parenthood on the grounds it violated protections of the S.C. Constitution (Article I, Section 10). RELATED | WHAT’S NEXT FOR SOUTH CAROLINA ABORTION DEBATE? The court’s 3-2 decision to overturn the heartbeat bill sent lawmakers back to the drawing board, and in May of this year they passed a second version of the 2021 ban – Act No. 70 of 2023. This bill was specifically crafted in response to concerns raised by the court. The court upheld the new law by a 4-1 vote, with a majority of justices determining lawmakers had erased their doubts as to the supposedly “arbitrary” nature of the six-week standard. As noted, Kimbrell supported the six-week abortion ban – which Brock insists doesn’t go far enough. He is not alone in that contention, either. Several conservative Republican lawmakers have made it clear they intend to push a total abortion ban in the upcoming legislative session. “New dust is being kicked up at points all along the state’s ideological fault lines on this seismic issue,” I noted this summer. “Trenches are already being dug ahead of the second regular session of the 125th S.C. General Assembly – which is set to convene in Columbia, S.C. on January 9, 2024.” Keep it tuned to this media outlet to see how the issue continues to unfold … and to see whether Kimbrell and Brock’s debate ever takes place. Certainly my media outlet would me more than happy to host such an exchange – and broadcast it live for our readers to watch. I’d also be more than happy to travel to Spartanburg, S.C. to moderate the exchange, if both candidates consented. Will Folks is the founding editor of the news outlet you are currently reading.

2023-11-01	23:12:16+00:00		Florida attorney general, against criticism, seeks to keep abortion rights amendment off 2024 ballot	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-11-01/florida-attorney-general-against-criticism-seeks-to-keep-abortion-rights-amendment-off-2024-ballot	Florida’s Republican attorney general has asked the state Supreme Court to keep a proposed abortion rights amendment off the ballot, saying proponents are waging “a war” to protect the procedure and ultimately will seek to expand those rights in future years. But proponents of the proposed amendment said that Atty. Gen. Ashley Moody is playing politics and that her arguments fall legally short given what they call the precise language of the proposed measure. A group called Floridians Protecting Freedom has gathered nearly 500,000 of the 891,523 voter signatures needed ahead of a Feb. 1 deadline for signatures to put the proposal on the 2024 ballot. The state Supreme Court would be tasked with ensuring the ballot language isn’t misleading and applies to a single subject if it goes before voters. The proposed amendment would allow abortions to remain legal until a fetus is viable. But Moody has argued that abortion rights proponents and opponents have differing interpretations as to what viability means. Those differences along with the failure to define “health” and “health-care provider,” she said, are enough to deceive voters and potentially open a box of legal questions in the future. “The ballot summary here is part of a ... design to lay ticking time bombs that will enable abortion proponents later to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought,” she argued in a 50-page brief. A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, leaving abortion decisions to states, where is abortion banned or protected? What comes next? June 25, 2023 She said that although prior court decisions have used viability as a term meaning whether the fetus can survive outside the womb, “others will understand ‘viability’ in the more traditional clinical sense — as referring to a pregnancy that, but for an abortion or other misfortune, will result in the child’s live birth.” Proponents disputed those statements. “The proposed amendment is very clear and precise,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release. “The term viability is a medical one, and in the context of abortion has always meant the stage of fetal development when the life of a fetus is sustainable outside the womb through standard medical measures.” The GOP-dominated Florida Legislature on Thursday approved a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a proposal signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis later in the day. April 13, 2023 Republicans have dominated state politics and controlled the governor’s office and both branches of the Legislature since 1999. In that time, the state has consistently chipped away at abortion rights, including creating a waiting period before the procedure can be performed, parental notification if minors seek abortion and forcing women to have an ultrasound before having an abortion. A law Gov. Ron DeSantis approved last year banning abortion after 15 weeks is being challenged in court. If the courts uphold the law — DeSantis appointed five of the Supreme Court’s seven justices — a bill DeSantis signed this year will ban abortion after six weeks, which is before many women know they are pregnant. DeSantis, who is running for president, has said he would support a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks. If the amendment makes the ballot it will need at least 60% voter approval to take effect.
2023-11-01	22:25:36+00:00		Idaho mother-son duo charged with kidnapping after transporting minor to Oregon for abortion	https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-mother-son-duo-charged-kidnapping-transporting-minor-oregon-abortion	Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son's minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl's mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion. With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year. NEBRASKA WOMAN WHO HELPED BURN, CONCEAL DAUGHTER'S ABORTION GETS 2-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren't relying on it. According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend's house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho. The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant. A mother and son from Idaho have been charged with kidnapping for transporting the latter's underage girlfriend to Bend, Oregon, for an abortion. According to court documents, the girl said she was "happy" when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship. The boyfriend's mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to "kick her out of their house" if she did. The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl's cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time. The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was "mutually agreed upon" between the girl and her son. She said she never "coerced" anyone into having an abortion. Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl. The mother is also facing multiple drug charges. Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to "keep or conceal" the girl from her parents by transporting "the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion." Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment.
