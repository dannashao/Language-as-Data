The staff member then repeats the response when the operator asks, “What exactly happened?” (RELATED: Swing State Dems Launch Bid To Enshrine Abortion In State Constitution) “Ok do you have any more information so I can update our crew that’s responding?” the operator presses. “So it’s basically bleeding from a difficult procedure,” the clinic worker says, specifying that the patient, who ended up in the hospital, was bleeding from her cervix. “There was a complicated procedure. They said bleeding.” Just last week at an abortion clinic in Dayton, a women suffered from bleeding due to complications in an abortion. Issue 1 would eviscerate key health and safety standards putting countless more women at risk. pic.twitter.com/YXyiOjsZsU — Protect Women Ohio (@ProtectWomenOH) November 1, 2023 Ohioans are preparing to vote on a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw restrictions on abortion before “fetal viability,” and allow abortion up to birth if the pregnancy is deemed dangerous to the health of the mother. Opponents of the proposal have argued that the amendment would strike down parental consent laws surrounding abortion, placing young women at risk of undergoing dangerous procedures without their parents’ knowledge. In August, Ohio voters rejected an attempt to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution. The measure would have raised the threshold from 50 percent to 60 percent, making it harder for pro-abortion activists to rally the support necessary to enshrine abortion in the state’s constitution. “Issue 1 will also increase the number of ‘self abortions’ by women at home, without the presence of any medical personnel, which can only result in even more 911 calls from frantic women from their homes,” Dayton Right to Life said in a press release.

2023-11-02	19:25:00+00:00		Tennessee & Idaho Are Using Cruel Attacks to Dismiss Lawsuits Against Their Abortion Bans	https://jezebel.com/tennessee-idaho-are-using-cruel-attacks-to-dismiss-la-1850986077	Attorneys general for Tennessee and Idaho both filed motions to dismiss abortion rights lawsuits brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights in their states this week. In both cases, their motions use cruel language and personal attacks against the plaintiffs—women who have been directly impacted by the states’ abortion bans and are seeking to clarify what circumstances fall under the narrow exception for medical emergencies that these bans claim to include. Tennessee’s motion, filed Wednesday, claims that plaintiff Nicole Blackmon—who says she suffered “physical and emotional torture” from being forced to carry a nonviable pregnancy for months—doesn’t have standing to sue because she’s since had her tubes tied. The state suggests this limits the chances that she’ll become pregnant and be personally impacted by the ban again and that it’s insufficient for her to “sue so ‘no one else’ will suffer.” Meanwhile, Idaho’s motion filed earlier this week claims the state ban is an attempt to prioritize “by all legal means, live childbirth over abortion,” regardless of fetal conditions that could be antithetical to life. Tennessee bans abortion beginning at conception with exceptions only for endangerment to the life of the pregnant person, to preserve their health, or if the fetus isn’t viable. Three women who were denied emergency abortion care and two doctors are suing to demand that the state clarify what is included under the umbrella of these narrow exceptions. Idaho also bans abortion beginning at conception with exceptions only for endangerment of the life of the pregnant person and rape and incest. Four women who were denied emergency abortion care, two doctors, and Idaho Academy of Family Physicians are suing the state, also demanding clarification for when emergency abortions are permitted under these exceptions. What we’re seeing from Tennessee and Idaho closely reflects the cruelty and callousness of other anti-abortion state attorneys general who have worked to throw out lawsuits challenging their bans—often enough, by leveling personal attacks at the plaintiffs. In July, lawyers for Texas fought another suit by the Center for Reproductive Rights, also to clarify an exception for threats to the pregnant person’s life, by making arguments similar to Tennessee’s. The state claimed that because some of the plaintiffs’ fertility had been jeopardized by pregnancy complications and being denied timely emergency abortion care, these women didn’t have standing to sue because it was less likely they’d become pregnant and need to seek abortion care again. One of the plaintiffs called this framing “infuriating” and “ironic,” adding, “Do they not realize the reason why I might not be able to get pregnant again is because of what happened to me as a result of the laws that they support?” Blackmon, who became pregnant in July 2022 shortly after Tennessee’s abortion ban took effect, initially saw her pregnancy as a “blessing” until, 15 weeks in, she learned her fetus suffered from omphalocele. This condition impedes the development of the fetus’ abdominal wall, resulting in organs growing outside the body. Blackmon’s doctors told her this was a lethal anomaly and continuing the pregnancy endangered her health. But despite Tennessee’s narrow exception for such emergencies, she was still denied abortion care. Now, in the wake of her tubal ligation procedure, Blackmon’s experience has been invalidated by Tennessee’s motion this week, which she accuses of “trying to pretend” that what she experienced “never happened.” Her statement continues, “No one should ever have to go through what I went through. Tennessee lawmakers put my life in danger with this abortion ban. My fellow plaintiffs and I are asking for the bare minimum—the right to basic health care during the many risky complications that arise during pregnancy.” The motion also references one of Blackmon’s co-plaintiffs, Allyson Phillips, who learned 18 weeks into her pregnancy that her unborn daughter was incompatible with life. The state points to Phillips’ similar motivations for joining the lawsuit to “prevent any other person” from sharing her experience, calling this insufficient grounds for a lawsuit. The state then invokes how Phillips is “now running for state office to change the abortion laws,” unsubtly suggesting her involvement in the suit is for political gain. On Tuesday, Idaho filed its own motion to dismiss a similar lawsuit. In addition to claiming that Idaho’s ban is designed to “prefer...live childbirth” even “in cases in which a physician believes that the child will die shortly after birth,” it states that, “The statutes simply do not allow for an abortion in situations in which an unborn child is ‘unlikely’ to survive after birth.” This language is deeply callous in the face of people who have been forced to carry nonviable pregnancies to term and suffer the heartbreak of birthing a newborn that dies hours or days later. “Idaho lawmakers put these women through the unthinkable and now the state wants them thrown out of court,” Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement this week. In April, Jennifer Adkins, the lead plaintiff in the Idaho suit, learned her fetus had Turner syndrome and other severe anomalies incompatible with life. She was still forced to travel to Oregon for emergency abortion care, and, fearing criminal penalties, her medical team couldn’t even help refer her to a provider. In a statement responding to Idaho’s motion this week, Adkins accused Idaho’s laws of “[putting] my life at risk and [compounding] my heartbreak,” as she grieved giving up a wanted pregnancy. “The humane response would be for Idaho officials to acknowledge the harm these laws are causing and to expand the exceptions in their abortion ban,” she said in a statement. “Instead, the attorney general is literally trying to dismiss me and the other women in this case. It’s degrading and insulting.”

Has the equation changed at all? Though not on the ballot, Glenn Youngkin hopes to rally Virginia Republicans to victory in state elections as he hopes to pass a 15-week abortion ban Voters are headed to the polls in two states where the “Dobbs Effect” will face its latest test. A year after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ended federal protections for abortion in Dobbs vs Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the issue of abortion is back on the ballot in two battleground states that will each play a major role in next year’s presidential election. In Ohio, voters will consider an amendment to the state constitution enshrining “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom” as a right of all Ohioans, allowing for some limits on the practice of abortion but generally protecting it from an all-out ban or severe restrictions. And in Virginia, the state’s Republican governor is rallying his party around a 15-week abortion ban, and encouraging a perception of the state House of Delegates and Senate as either a green light or a roadblock ahead of the implementation of that legislation. Republicans took the governor’s mansion and House of Delegates in 2021, leaving Democrats in control of just one corner of government. All eyes are on these two states in the political world for obvious reasons: the pair of states are two major battlegrounds for presidential elections, though Ohio has trended increasingly red in recent cycles. The elections also represent the first real test of the American electorate in terms of abortion views since last year’s midterm congressional elections, when Republicans saw their “red wave” evaporate into a defeat in the Senate and a razor-thin unruly House majority. While some in the beltway media sphere proclaimed that backlash from the Supreme Court’s spring decision tossing Roe v Wade’s precedent — the “Dobbs Effect” – would subside before the 2022 midterms, the clear reality was that voters who support abortion rights delivered major victories for both Democrats and the pro-choice movement specifically last year. The victories occurred in purple and red states as well as blue Democratic strongholds, signalling that the momentum was headed in the opposite direction of the hardline pro-life movement. This year, Republicans are hoping that the trend will reverse itself. In Ohio, where municipal races are the only ones on the ballot this year, the result will be a clear referendum on the issue, and Question 1 will be the largest factor drawing voters to the polls. Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin, who enjoys reasonably positive approval ratings, is not on the ballot either; and legislative priorities may take greater importance over the personalities of lesser-known candidates for state offices at the polls in the Old Dominion state. The question of what the “Dobbs Effect” will look like in Virginia is a particularly interesting one. Mr Youngkin, cognisant of the fact that Democrats and abortion rights maintain serious support bases in the state, has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars via his Spirit of Virginia PAC into sculpting the conversation around his proposed ban — which he insists should not be referred to as such. Ads are demanding that reporters refer to the proposal as a “reasonable limit” on abortion, noting exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies. It’s essentially an admission from Mr Youngkin and the state GOP that a “ban” is politically unpopular and would be rejected by voters in a purple state. At the same time, he has won praise from major anti-abortion groups, which suggests that they see his strategy as the path forward for their movement in such areas. A spokesman for Mr Youngkin’s PAC told The Washington Post last week that the reason Republicans were shellacked so handily in areas where abortion was on the ballot in 2022 came down to a lack of aggression from the GOP in response to criticism on the issue. “There was no Republican response, none, and the results were tough in the ’22 midterms,” Zack Roday told the Post. “Republicans didn’t talk about where they were. They didn’t swat back the misstatements, the sometimes outright lies.” That theory will be put to the test on Tuesday. If Mr Youngkin and the Virginia GOP eke out a victory, it could mean a major watershed moment for the anti-abortion movement — a meaningful election result it can point to when challenged on the popularity of its agenda. Should they lose ground in the state’s legislative branch, it will instead reinforce a different idea, one driven home in 2022: That the left controls the momentum on this issue; the latest front to turn against conservatives in the culture war.

2023-11-02	18:50:28+00:00	JULIE CARR SMYTH Associated Press	An Ohio amendment serves as a testing ground for statewide abortion fights expected in 2024	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/an-ohio-amendment-serves-as-a-testing-ground-for-statewide-abortion-fights-expected-in-2024/	COLUMBUS, Ohio | Abortion access is expected to play a central role in the 2024 elections. The preview comes next week, when Ohio voters decide whether to enshrine reproductive rights in their state Constitution. The amendment is the only abortion question on any state’s ballot this year, a spotlight that has generated intense attention from national groups and made Ohio a testing ground for fresh campaign messaging — some of it misleading. The amendment has drawn more than $60 million in combined spending so far. Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year’s presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Initiatives seeking to protect access could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. “When we’re able to see how our messaging impacts independents and Republicans and persuades them that this fundamental freedom is important to protect in Ohio, that’s going to be something that we can implement looking at 2024,” she said. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. The battleground on abortion shifted to the states last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, erasing federal abortion protections that had been in place for half a century. Since then, voters in six states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — have either supported measures protecting abortion rights or rejected efforts aimed at eroding access. Kelsey Pritchard, state public affairs director for the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said the outcomes in 2022 offered lessons that the anti-abortion movement has implemented in Ohio through more coalition-building and stronger messaging. Abortion opponents, she said, “will apply those weapons and learning in other states going forward.” Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose advanced ballot language for the Ohio amendment that its supporters said was misleading, while GOP Attorney General Dave Yost took the unconventional step of producing his own “legal analysis” of the amendment. Its supporters said those actions by top state officials could cost them votes. But like the anti-abortion movement itself, Ohio’s Republicans have not been in lockstep on the issue. The GOP-led Ohio Senate has used its website to spread misleading claims about the amendment even as Gov. Mike DeWine has made the rounds of TV stations pledging that his party will pass a reasonable alternative if voters defeat the measure. For the first time in his 46-year political career, DeWine now says he would support exceptions for rape and incest in any future abortion legislation if the measure fails. The governor has allied with the Ohio Catholic Conference, which is running a campaign through its churches to defeat the amendment, which is on the ballot as Issue 1. Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against it, also has generated support from some Black faith leaders. Supporters have answered with an ad featuring the senior minister of First Congregational Church in Columbus, who called abortion a private matter and said “government needs to stay out of family decision-making.” The Ohio amendment would guarantee an individual’s right “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” It expressly permits the state to regulate abortions after fetal viability, as determined by an attending physician, as long as any laws regulating the procedure after that point provide exceptions for the life and health of the woman. Its supporters include Democrats in the state, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and a bipartisan coalition of labor, faith and community groups. They portray the measure — one of the most broadly worded so far — as a way to enshrine Roe-era abortion rights in a one-time bellwether state that has turned increasingly Republican and has passed some of the nation’s toughest restrictions on the procedure. That includes a law currently held up by legal challenges that bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, before many women know they’re pregnant. That law makes no exceptions for rape or incest. “This is the most conservative state to date where we’re pushing for proactive state constitutional amendments,” said Carolyn Ehrlich, senior campaign strategist at the ACLU. Opponents, including state Republicans, the Center for Christian Virtue and Ohio Right to Life, say the amendment provides too much access to abortion and does so too late into pregnancy. They question whether state lawmakers could pass any abortion restrictions at all that would pass constitutional muster if voters approve the amendment. “This is more than just a pro-choice or pro-life statement,” said Megan Wold, a former deputy Ohio solicitor general working with Protect Women Ohio. “It is an up or down vote, but it’s an up or down vote on very particular language that’s going to have a real impact on the way that Ohio can regulate abortion in the future.” Protect Women Ohio’s interest in persuading independent and politically moderate voters is about the math, since public support for some form of abortion rights has remained well over the 50% mark in the U.S. for years. AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal. Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday. He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state “and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they’re going to reject it.” The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio’s was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. “I think there’s a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said. McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. “Ohio voters really know what’s at stake here, because they’ve seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people’s lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.” Fernando reported from Chicago.

2023-11-02	17:05:18+00:00		Senate sidesteps Tuberville’s hold and confirms new Navy head, first female on Joint Chiefs of Staff	https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/general-election/3257063/senate-sidesteps-tubervilles-hold-and-confirms-new-navy-head-first-female-on-joint-chiefs-of-staff.html	 Senate confirms three military officers as Sen. Tuberville holds up hundreds more WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate confirmed three top military officers on Thursday — including the first female member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — as bipartisan frustration swirled around Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville for blocking hundreds more nominees. Republican senators plan to hold a closed-door meeting next week to discuss the Alabama senator’s blockade of senior military nominees, which he has been waging over a Pentagon abortion policy. Republicans have tried, unsuccessfully, for almost nine months to quietly persuade Tuberville to drop the holds on almost 400 nominees. Senior military officials have warned repeatedly that the situation threatens readiness and national security. Anger over Tuberville’s tactic spilled out in the Senate on Wednesday evening, when a group of Republican senators held the floor for more than four hours and called up 61 of the nominations for votes, praising each nominee for their military service and challenging the Alabama senator to explain himself. Tuberville showed no signs of letting up, quietly standing and objecting to each one even as his colleagues lashed out at him. With Tuberville dug in, there are no easy answers on how to move forward. Republicans said they will continue to try and negotiate with him, hoping to persuade Tuberville to hold up civilian nominees instead, and said that they will also try to force more votes. Democrats want stronger action and are seeking to move forward with a resolution that would allow batches of military nominees to be passed over Tuberville’s objections. But that would need Republican support, and GOP senators are wary it could set a bad precedent that erodes the power of the minority in the Senate. Whatever the next steps, Tuberville’s Republican colleagues made clear that they are fed up. “It’s time to develop a new and smarter strategy,” said Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who served in the Marine Corps and was one of the senators who criticized Tuberville’s blockade on the Senate floor. The Senate on Thursday confirmed three of the nominees that Tuberville was holding up — Adm. Lisa Franchetti to lead the Navy, Gen. David Allvin to be chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force and Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney to serve as assistant commandant for the U.S. Marine Corps. Franchetti is the first woman to serve as a Pentagon service chief and hold a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday he was pleased that the Senate confirmed the three officers. But “we still have more than 370 superbly qualified leaders who have seen their nominations unnecessarily stalled,” he said. “As we face a variety of urgent challenges, the most powerful fighting force in history must be at full-strength.” Austin said the delay is hurting readiness and “unnecessarily weighed down our military families, who already give up so much to support those who serve.” Because of Tuberville’s holds and Senate procedure, confirmation of those three military officials took three days and six votes from start to finish — underscoring the difficulty majority Democrats have as they contemplate how to move hundreds of nominations. The Senate has traditionally approved large groups of military nominations by voice vote, but just one senator’s objection can upend that process. Republican Sens. Young and Joni Ernst of Iowa each suggested on Thursday that there would be an effort to try and convince Tuberville to hold up civilian nominations linked to the abortion policy instead of military officers who have nothing to do with it. “Why are we taking hostages that can’t change the policy?” Ernst said. But Tuberville said Wednesday there is “zero chance” he will drop the holds, which he first announced in February. Despite several high-level vacancies and the growing backlog, he has said he will continue to hold the nominees up unless the Pentagon ends — or puts to a vote in Congress — its new policy of paying for travel when a servicemember has to go out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care. President Joe Biden’s administration instituted the policy after the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, and some states have limited or banned the procedure. “I cannot simply sit idly by while the Biden administration injects politics in our military from the White House and spends taxpayers’ dollars on abortion,” Tuberville said Wednesday evening. Confronting Tuberville publicly for the first time since he announced the holds, the Republican senators, led by Ernst and Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, read lengthy biographies, praised the nominees and lashed out at Tuberville as they called for vote after vote. They said they agree with the Alabama senator in opposing the abortion policy but questioned — as Democrats have for months — why he would hold up the highest ranks of the U.S. military. As Wednesday night wore on, Sullivan, a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, and Ernst, a former commander in the U.S. Army Reserve and Iowa Army National Guard, appeared increasingly frustrated. Sullivan called the blockade a “national security suicide mission.” The GOP senators noted that they were bringing up the nominations “one by one” as Tuberville had once called for, and they asked why he wouldn’t allow them to go forward. Tuberville did not answer. “I do not respect men who do not honor their word,” Ernst said of her GOP colleague toward the end of the evening. The Senate voted to confirm the three top officers on Thursday after the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, was hospitalized Sunday after suffering a medical emergency at his official residence in Washington. Smith, who is listed in stable condition and is recovering, was confirmed to the top job last month, but he had been holding down two high-level posts for several months because of Tuberville’s holds. Mahoney, who was confirmed as assistant commandant, could step into the acting commandant role as Smith recovers. He is a fighter pilot who has flown combat in Iraq and served as the deputy commander of Marine forces in the Pacific. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said after Mahoney’s confirmation that the holds have placed significant stress on the military’s officers and families. “We have seen tragic effects to that stress,” Hicks said. “And I think that’s been well communicated on Capitol Hill.” When Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced the vote this week on Mahoney’s nomination to be assistant commandant, he said Smith’s sudden medical emergency is “precisely the kind of avoidable emergency that Sen. Tuberville has provoked through his reckless holds.” Also confirmed was Franchetti, who will lead the Navy. She is the second woman to be promoted to four-star admiral, and did multiple deployments, including as commander of a naval destroyer and two stints as aircraft carrier strike group commander. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., called Franchetti a “trailblazer.” Several women have served as military service secretaries as political appointees, but never as their top uniformed officer. Adm. Linda L. Fagan is the commandant of the Coast Guard, but she is not a member of the Joint Staff. Allvin is the vice chief of staff of the Air Force but has been serving as acting chief since the previous top Air Force officer, Gen. CQ Brown, became c hairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Oct. 1. Allvin is a career air mobility pilot with more than 4,600 flight hours and key deployments in Afghanistan and Europe.

We've received your submission. An 18-year-old Idaho boy and his mother have been arrested after police said the teen raped a 15-year-old girl who was then taken across state lines to get an abortion without her parents’ permission. Kadyn Swainston and his mother, Rachael Swainston, 42, from Pocatello, have been hit with a slew of felony counts stemming from a months-long investigation. The teenager was charged with second-degree kidnapping, rape and producing child sexually exploitive material, reported the Idaho State Journal. His mom was also charged with kidnapping, as well as trafficking in methamphetamine, possession of fentanyl and psychedelic mushrooms and harboring a wanted felon. The probe that culminated with the mother and son’s arrests last week was launched on June 18 when a woman contacted the Pocatello Police Department to report that her 15-year-old daughter had been raped by Kadyn and later driven to Bend, Oregon, for an abortion. But the alleged victim claimed during a forensic interview at a child advocacy center in August that her relationship with Kadyn was consensual. She said the two of them began having sex when the boy was 17 and continued after he turned 18, according to a police report. The girl told the interviewer that not long after Kadyn’s 18th birthday, she found she was expecting a baby and was “happy” about the pregnancy. Kadyn, however, was not pleased with the prospect of becoming a father and allegedly demanded that the girl terminate the pregnancy, or he would not pay child support and would break up with her. On May 18, Rachael Swainston rented a car and traveled with Kadyn and the 15-year-old pregnant girl to a clinic in neighboring Oregon, where the youngster obtained an abortion. Her mother told police she did not consent to the procedure. The incident took place just months after Idaho adopted the so-called “abortion trafficking” law that makes it illegal for an adult to help a minor get an abortion without parental consent. Idaho is one of 13 states that effectively ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy, and is one of a handful of states that have laws penalizing those who help people of any age obtain abortions. Notably, neither Kadyn Swainston nor his mother has been charged under the new “abortion trafficking” law. Police obtained search warrants for Kadyn’s and Rachael’s phone records, which confirmed that they traveled to Oregon on May 18. The 15-year-old girl also allowed investigators to comb through the contents of her phone, which turned up three photos and video that showed her and Kadyn engaging in sex acts, according to police. When interviewed by investigators, Kadyn allegedly admitted to having sex with the girl when he was 18 years old and she was 15, and then taking her to Oregon to get an abortion. Rachael also allegedly admitted to transporting the 15-year-old to Oregon to get an abortion, but she said both the girl and her son had agreed to it. She denied forcing the teenage girl to end her pregnancy. Police executed a search warrant on Oct. 26 at the Swainstons’ home, where they allegedly found methamphetamine in the mother’s bedroom. They also arrested a man who was staying in the family’s storage shed on an outstanding felony warrant related to meth trafficking. The mother and son are due back in court for a preliminary hearing on Nov. 7. If convicted of their top charges — meth trafficking for Rachael and rape for Kadyn — they could face up to life in prison.

Mr Tuberville has been blocking the confirmations of new military leaders citing his opposition to the Department of Defense’s policy of paying for troops needing abortions to travel out of state for reproductive health care services if they are stationed in areas where the procedures have become unavailable following the striking down of the Roe v Wade ruling by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2022. The blockade has made several top-level officers perform multiple jobs concurrently. GOP senators pushed on Wednesday night for the confirmation of more than 60 military nominees but Mr Tuberville refused to give in. The effort was headed by Sen Dan Sullivan of Alaska and he was backed up by Sens Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Todd Young of Indiana, and Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. They each requested votes on every officer by unanimous consent, a process which took hours, but Mr Tuberville was there to block all of them. “The Pentagon has issued a legal opinion I disagree with saying this doesn't violate the Hyde Amendment. I disagree with it,” Mr Graham said before directly addressing Mr Tuberville. “You just denied this lady a promotion,” he said, holding up an image of one of the military nominees. “All of us are ready to promote her because she deserves to be promoted. She had nothing to do with this policy. Let me say it again, everybody in this body could find an issue with any administration they don't agree with.” “What we’re gonna do is open up Pandora’s Box. Today is abortion policy. If we take back the White House, we’ll go back to the Mexico City policy limiting dollars to be given to overseas entities that are engaged in the abortion business, some pro-choice people don’t like that,” Mr Graham, a former member of the Air Force, added. “What would happen if they put a hold on all the officers because they don’t agree with the Republican administration? There’s a reason this has not been done this way for a couple hundred years ... this is doing great damage to our military.” “I’ve been trying to work with you for nine months,” Mr Graham told the Alabama senator. “Folks, if this keeps going, people are going to leave,” he told the chamber. “There [are] some people that are waiting to be promoted, that if they don’t get promoted soon, they’re gonna be out of the military,” Mr Graham noted. “How does that help anybody if they’re qualified?” “We have done the best that we can to honour the request of a fellow senator that these nominations be brought to the floor and voted on individually,” Ms Ernst said. “And I really respect men of their word. I do not respect men who do not honour their word. We have brought forward nearly 60 nominees. Every one of them [has] been denied.” “We're impacting readiness, and we're definitely impacting morale – And that's readiness,” Mr Sullivan said. “My colleague’s saying, ‘Oh, don't worry, there's no problem, no readiness problems’. No offence, but that's just ridiculous and he knows it – We all know it.” “I want the American people to know right now 376 promotions to one, two, three, and four-star generals and admirals are being held,” Mr Sullivan said. “It is estimated by the end of this year 89 per cent of all general officer positions in the United States military will be affected by the current holds from Senator Tuberville ... This is pretty much the entire officer corps. This is hugely disruptive to readiness.” Calling the blockade, “a national security suicide mission,” Mr Sullivan said that “the idea that some of these officers are supposedly woke or desk jockeys, it’s ridiculous,” according to Politico. “Hang in there,” Mr Sullivan said, addressing the officers affected by the blockade. “We’ll be coming here every night to try to get you confirmed.” The Alaska senator said on several occasions that Mr Tuberville had previously committed to voting on individual nominees but the Alabamian continued to demand that the Pentagon end the policy before he would allow any confirmations. “I have to respectfully disagree with my colleagues about the effect of my hold on readiness. My hold is not affecting readiness,” he claimed. Mr Romney argued that the hold was “an abuse of the powers we have as senators”. This comes after Gen Eric Smith was hospitalised on Sunday after reportedly suffering a heart attack during a jog, according to The New York Times. The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democratic Sen Jack Reed of Rhode Island, told Politico “One of the reasons I think contributed to his condition was he was doing two jobs at once”. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the press that “patience is wearing thin with Sen Tuberville on both sides of the aisle”. “What happened with the Marine commandant just showed many people how dangerous what Tuberville is doing is,” he added. In a statement to The Independent on Wednesday, Mr Tuberville’s Communications Director Steven Stafford said: “Coach is praying for a swift recovery for General Smith and he has gathered enough signatures on a cloture petition to force Senator Schumer to vote on confirming General Mahoney to be Assistant Commandant.” On Thursday morning, Mr Tuberville told reporters that the criticism he faced was “a little character assassination at times” but that he remains firm on his blockade. He again rejected the notion that his actions are affecting military readiness. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies U.S. Sen.

2023-11-02	09:41:05+00:00	Michael Gryboski                                                                                  02 November 2023 | 9:42 AM	Most Brits support banning pro-life protests outside abortion clinics: poll	https://www.christiantoday.com/article/most.brits.support.banning.pro.life.protests.outside.abortion.clinics.poll/140970.htm	(CP) A little over three-quarters of British citizens are in favour of banning pro-life protests outside abortion clinics, according to the recently released findings of a survey. According to a YouGov UKÂ poll released earlier this month, 77% of British citizens approve of banning protests that occur in the "immediate surroundings of abortion clinics," while 14% oppose banning them and 9% are not sure. Support for a ban on abortion clinic protests was slightly higher for women than men, with 81% of female respondents expressing support for a ban, versus 76% of male respondents. The poll found that 49% of respondents supported the current legal limit of allowing elective abortion up until 24 weeks into a pregnancy, with only 25% of respondents saying it should be pushed back to earlier into a pregnancy. On a related question, 65% of respondents said that they support allowing abortion for any reason for up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, with 16% saying it should only be available during that time for "specific circumstances, such as disability or risk to the health of the mother." The poll results were derivedÂ from a survey of 2,098 Britons conducted Sept. 28-29, with no margin of error listed. In recent times, there have been efforts in the United Kingdom to ban pro-life demonstrations and vigils held near abortion providers by creating buffer zones around clinics. Last December, the United Kingdom Supreme Court upheldÂ a law passed in Northern Ireland that prohibits demonstrations near abortion facilities, with the court arguing that "this restriction can be justified" as it "pursues a legitimate aim." "It seeks to ensure that women have access to advice and treatment related to the lawful termination of a pregnancy under conditions which respect their privacy and dignity and are not driven instead to less safe alternatives," wrote U.K. Supreme Court President Robert John Reed for the court. "It is also designed to enable staff who work at hospitals and clinics where terminations are available to attend their place of work without being intimidated, harassed, or abused." Activist Isabel Vaughan-Spruce faced a months-long legal battleÂ after she was arrested for silently praying outside an abortion clinic in Birmingham, England. In September, West Midlands Police announced that, following a six-month investigation, they would not bring chargesÂ against Vaughan-Spruce for her silent prayer. "The arduous process of this criminal ordeal has been the punishment for Isabel. Moreover, her story has put the world on notice that fundamental freedoms are vulnerable in the UK," said Jeremiah Igunnubole, legal counsel for the U.K. chapter of the Alliance Defending Freedom, who helped to represent Vaughan-Spruce, in a statement released in September. "There is now an urgent need for legal changes to stem the tide of policing by politics. We hope the decision from West Midlands Police that they will not prosecute free thought, alongside the Home Secretary's public commitment to protecting silent prayer, will be reflected in legislation, guidance, and practice."

2023-11-02	05:10:29+00:00	ABC News	Ohio amendment serves as test for statewide abortion fights expected in 2024	https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ohio-amendment-serves-testing-ground-statewide-abortion-fights-104564718	COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Abortion access is expected to play a central role in the 2024 elections. The preview comes next week, when Ohio voters decide whether to enshrine reproductive rights in their state Constitution. The amendment is the only abortion question on any state's ballot this year, a spotlight that has generated intense attention from national groups and made Ohio a testing ground for fresh campaign messaging — some of it misleading. The amendment has drawn more than $60 million in combined spending so far. Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year's presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Initiatives seeking to protect access could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. "When we’re able to see how our messaging impacts independents and Republicans and persuades them that this fundamental freedom is important to protect in Ohio, that’s going to be something that we can implement looking at 2024,” she said. The battleground on abortion shifted to the states last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, erasing federal abortion protections that had been in place for half a century. Since then, voters in six states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — have either supported measures protecting abortion rights or rejected efforts aimed at eroding access. Kelsey Pritchard, state public affairs director for the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said the outcomes in 2022 offered lessons that the anti-abortion movement has implemented in Ohio through more coalition-building and stronger messaging. Abortion opponents, she said, “will apply those weapons and learning in other states going forward.” Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose advanced ballot language for the Ohio amendment that its supporters said was misleading, while GOP Attorney General Dave Yost took the unconventional step of producing his own ”legal analysis" of the amendment. Its supporters said those actions by top state officials could cost them votes. But like the anti-abortion movement itself, Ohio’s Republicans have not been in lockstep on the issue. The GOP-led Ohio Senate has used its website to spread misleading claims about the amendment even as Gov. Mike DeWine has made the rounds of TV stations pledging that his party will pass a reasonable alternative if voters defeat the measure. For the first time in his 46-year political career, DeWine now says he would support exceptions for rape and incest in any future abortion legislation if the measure fails. The governor has allied with the Ohio Catholic Conference, which is running a campaign through its churches to defeat the amendment, which is on the ballot as Issue 1. Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against it, also has generated support from some Black faith leaders. Supporters have answered with an ad featuring the senior minister of First Congregational Church in Columbus, who called abortion a private matter and said “government needs to stay out of family decision-making.” The Ohio amendment would guarantee an individual’s right “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” It expressly permits the state to regulate abortions after fetal viability, as determined by an attending physician, as long as any laws regulating the procedure after that point provide exceptions for the life and health of the woman. Its supporters include Democrats in the state, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and a bipartisan coalition of labor, faith and community groups. They portray the measure — one of the most broadly worded so far — as a way to enshrine Roe-era abortion rights in a one-time bellwether state that has turned increasingly Republican and has passed some of the nation's toughest restrictions on the procedure. That includes a law currently held up by legal challenges that bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, before many women know they're pregnant. That law makes no exceptions for rape or incest. “This is the most conservative state to date where we’re pushing for proactive state constitutional amendments,” said Carolyn Ehrlich, senior campaign strategist at the ACLU. Opponents, including state Republicans, the Center for Christian Virtue and Ohio Right to Life, say the amendment provides too much access to abortion and does so too late into pregnancy. They question whether state lawmakers could pass any abortion restrictions at all that would pass constitutional muster if voters approve the amendment. “This is more than just a pro-choice or pro-life statement," said Megan Wold, a former deputy Ohio solicitor general working with Protect Women Ohio. “It is an up or down vote, but it’s an up or down vote on very particular language that’s going to have a real impact on the way that Ohio can regulate abortion in the future." Protect Women Ohio's interest in persuading independent and politically moderate voters is about the math, since public support for some form of abortion rights has remained well over the 50% mark in the U.S. for years. AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal. Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday. He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state "and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they're going to reject it.” The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio's was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. “I think there's a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said. McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. “Ohio voters really know what's at stake here, because they've seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people's lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.” Fernando reported from Chicago.

2023-11-02	04:59:36+00:00		Mother, son charged with kidnapping after police say they took a Pocatello teenager to Oregon for an abortion	https://www.cachevalleydaily.com/news/archive/2023/11/01/mother-son-charged-with-kidnapping-after-police-say-they-took-a-pocatello-teenager-to-oregon-for-an-abortion/	An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son’s minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl’s mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion. With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year. Idaho’s Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren’t relying on it. According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend’s house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho. The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant. According to court documents, the girl said she was “happy” when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship. The boyfriend’s mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to “kick her out of their house” if she did. The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles (885 km) from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl’s cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time. The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was “mutually agreed upon” between the girl and her son. She said she she never “coerced” anyone into having an abortion. Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl. The mother is also facing multiple drug charges. Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.” Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment.

AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal. Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday. He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state “and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they’re going to reject it.” The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio’s was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. “I think there’s a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said. McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. “Ohio voters really know what’s at stake here, because they’ve seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people’s lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.” Fernando reported from Chicago.

Kwazulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg Judge Nkosinathi Chili was also not convinced by Zuma's advocate Dali Mpofu's arguments that Downer and this writer must be ordered to appear in court when the private prosecution returns to court on 9 April 2024. Instead, the judge directed "that the parties will be represented by their respective legal representatives on the day."

It’s been a little over two months since South Carolina’s supreme court upheld a new abortion law banning the practice in almost all cases after six weeks. That decision – which effectively undid a previous ruling outlawing the six-week ban – was presumed to have been the last word on this hot-button issue in the Palmetto State for the foreseeable future. And many – if not most – occupying leadership positions within the S.C. General Assembly certainly hoped that would be the case. Was it? As I noted in an expansive treatment published just a week after the court’s recent ruling, abortion policy is continuing to generate significant heat among members of the S.C. General Assembly – and among those seeking to challenge them for their seats. “Republican” lawmakers who thought they’d dealt with the issue decisively already are now facing fresh criticism from staunch pro-lifers eager to see them go further – by banning abortion from the moment of conception. In Spartanburg County, for example, one incumbent senator who voted for the new six-week ban is being challenged to debate his position with a would-be rival who supports the broader ban – a challenge he appears willing to accept. Josh Kimbrell won his seat in the S.C. Senate in 2020 – ousting veteran Democrat Glenn Reese. Kimbrell is running for reelection in 2024 – possibly as a stepping stone to a gubernatorial campaign in 2026. In recent days, though, the aviation executive has found himself the focus of withering criticism from pro-life advocate Matt Brock. Brock is the executive director of Equal Protection South Carolina (EPSC), a group which exists for the purpose of “establishing justice for the pre-born.” “I believe babies in the womb, from the moment of fertilization are as equal in value as humans outside the womb,” Brock told me. “Therefore, I believe they are deserving of equal protection and equal justice under the law and are covered under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Brock has been challenging Kimbrell – whom he deems insufficiently conservative on the issue of abortion – to debate him on this issue. “In the spirit of integrity, transparency and consistency, I would like to publicly challenge my senator, Josh Kimbrell, to a public moderated debate,” Brock wrote on his Facebook page recently. “To put the odds even more in his favor, I’m happy to do it at HIS church with HIS pastor moderating.” Brock also offered to pay $1,000 to anyone willing to set up the debate. Will Kimbrell take Brock up on his challenge? According to a recent Facebook comment, the answer to that question would appear to be “yes.” “I’m the true conservative leader here and you’re a charlatan,” Kimbrell wrote in the Facebook comment. “You want a debate you better bring your A-game, bro.” As the two discussed potential moderators, times and venues for the debate, Kimbrell did introduce one caveat into the equation. “I’m doing this only if it’s not a con job by you,” he wrote. To recap: The authority of the state to regulate abortion has been firmly established by the U.S. supreme court’s recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had maintained a national right to abortion for the last half century. The overturning of Roe effectively legalized state abortion bans including the so-called “heartbeat bill” – which outlawed a majority of abortions in the Palmetto State once a fetal heartbeat had been detected. In January of this year, however, the state court struck down the heartbeat bill – specifically the six-week requirement of the law – after it was challenged by the South Atlantic office of national abortion provider Planned Parenthood on the grounds it violated protections of the S.C. Constitution (Article I, Section 10). RELATED | WHAT’S NEXT FOR SOUTH CAROLINA ABORTION DEBATE? The court’s 3-2 decision to overturn the heartbeat bill sent lawmakers back to the drawing board, and in May of this year they passed a second version of the 2021 ban – Act No. 70 of 2023. This bill was specifically crafted in response to concerns raised by the court. The court upheld the new law by a 4-1 vote, with a majority of justices determining lawmakers had erased their doubts as to the supposedly “arbitrary” nature of the six-week standard. As noted, Kimbrell supported the six-week abortion ban – which Brock insists doesn’t go far enough. He is not alone in that contention, either. Several conservative Republican lawmakers have made it clear they intend to push a total abortion ban in the upcoming legislative session. “New dust is being kicked up at points all along the state’s ideological fault lines on this seismic issue,” I noted this summer. “Trenches are already being dug ahead of the second regular session of the 125th S.C. General Assembly – which is set to convene in Columbia, S.C. on January 9, 2024.” Keep it tuned to this media outlet to see how the issue continues to unfold … and to see whether Kimbrell and Brock’s debate ever takes place. Certainly my media outlet would me more than happy to host such an exchange – and broadcast it live for our readers to watch. I’d also be more than happy to travel to Spartanburg, S.C. to moderate the exchange, if both candidates consented. Will Folks is the founding editor of the news outlet you are currently reading.

2023-11-01	23:12:16+00:00		Florida attorney general, against criticism, seeks to keep abortion rights amendment off 2024 ballot	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-11-01/florida-attorney-general-against-criticism-seeks-to-keep-abortion-rights-amendment-off-2024-ballot	Florida’s Republican attorney general has asked the state Supreme Court to keep a proposed abortion rights amendment off the ballot, saying proponents are waging “a war” to protect the procedure and ultimately will seek to expand those rights in future years. But proponents of the proposed amendment said that Atty. Gen. Ashley Moody is playing politics and that her arguments fall legally short given what they call the precise language of the proposed measure. A group called Floridians Protecting Freedom has gathered nearly 500,000 of the 891,523 voter signatures needed ahead of a Feb. 1 deadline for signatures to put the proposal on the 2024 ballot. The state Supreme Court would be tasked with ensuring the ballot language isn’t misleading and applies to a single subject if it goes before voters. The proposed amendment would allow abortions to remain legal until a fetus is viable. But Moody has argued that abortion rights proponents and opponents have differing interpretations as to what viability means. Those differences along with the failure to define “health” and “health-care provider,” she said, are enough to deceive voters and potentially open a box of legal questions in the future. “The ballot summary here is part of a ... design to lay ticking time bombs that will enable abortion proponents later to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought,” she argued in a 50-page brief. A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, leaving abortion decisions to states, where is abortion banned or protected? What comes next? June 25, 2023 She said that although prior court decisions have used viability as a term meaning whether the fetus can survive outside the womb, “others will understand ‘viability’ in the more traditional clinical sense — as referring to a pregnancy that, but for an abortion or other misfortune, will result in the child’s live birth.” Proponents disputed those statements. “The proposed amendment is very clear and precise,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release. “The term viability is a medical one, and in the context of abortion has always meant the stage of fetal development when the life of a fetus is sustainable outside the womb through standard medical measures.” The GOP-dominated Florida Legislature on Thursday approved a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a proposal signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis later in the day. April 13, 2023 Republicans have dominated state politics and controlled the governor’s office and both branches of the Legislature since 1999. In that time, the state has consistently chipped away at abortion rights, including creating a waiting period before the procedure can be performed, parental notification if minors seek abortion and forcing women to have an ultrasound before having an abortion. A law Gov. Ron DeSantis approved last year banning abortion after 15 weeks is being challenged in court. If the courts uphold the law — DeSantis appointed five of the Supreme Court’s seven justices — a bill DeSantis signed this year will ban abortion after six weeks, which is before many women know they are pregnant. DeSantis, who is running for president, has said he would support a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks. If the amendment makes the ballot it will need at least 60% voter approval to take effect.
2023-11-01	22:25:36+00:00		Idaho mother-son duo charged with kidnapping after transporting minor to Oregon for abortion	https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-mother-son-duo-charged-kidnapping-transporting-minor-oregon-abortion	Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son's minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl's mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion. With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year. NEBRASKA WOMAN WHO HELPED BURN, CONCEAL DAUGHTER'S ABORTION GETS 2-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren't relying on it. According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend's house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho. The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant. A mother and son from Idaho have been charged with kidnapping for transporting the latter's underage girlfriend to Bend, Oregon, for an abortion. According to court documents, the girl said she was "happy" when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship. The boyfriend's mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to "kick her out of their house" if she did. The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl's cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time. The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was "mutually agreed upon" between the girl and her son. She said she never "coerced" anyone into having an abortion. Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl. The mother is also facing multiple drug charges. Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to "keep or conceal" the girl from her parents by transporting "the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion." Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment.

2023-11-01	21:57:34+00:00	By Sage Alexander | salexander@times-standard.com	AG says law enforcement can’t share license plate data	https://www.times-standard.com/2023/11/01/ag-says-law-enforcement-cant-share-license-plate-data/	In May, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and California’s chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union asked the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office and 70 other law enforcement agencies to stop sharing data from Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) with other states, citing concern about the use of people’s locations in states that have banned abortion and federal immigration enforcement. The groups also noted state laws that protect data were not being followed. The state Attorney General’s Office released legal guidance on the way data should be shared, noting law enforcement agencies should only share information with other California law enforcement agencies. “Importantly, the definition of “public agency” is limited to state or local agencies, including law enforcement agencies, and does not include out-of-state or federal law enforcement agencies,” the guidance document from John D. Marsh notes. Samantha Karges, a former spokesperson for the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office noted in a June 2 email the agency used a single Automated License Plate Reader attached to a car in a testing phase last year. She said this data is not shared with federal law enforcement agencies tasked with immigration enforcement. Three deputies were trained to use the system. According to documents shared by the EFF as a result of a public records request, HCSO shares Automated License Plate Reader information with hundreds of other agencies. From January to November 2022, it read 244,457 license plates and got 4,220 “hits,” according to the public records request. The EFF said prosecutors in other states could use the ALPRs data to find people who have traveled to California for abortions, as the data was shared with law enforcement agencies in states with abortion bans. ALPRs are generally affixed to traffic signals or on top of police cars and collect information uploaded to databases that include some law enforcement agencies. They show the location of a vehicle and the license plate at a specific moment and can provide leads for law enforcement investigating crime according to Karges. The EFF applauded the release from the California Attorney General’s office. “Victory! California Attorney General Rob Bonta has confirmed what we’ve been saying for years: It is against the law for California law enforcement agencies to share data collected from automated license plate readers with out-of-state or federal agencies. This guidance will protect abortion seekers, immigrants, and indeed anyone who drives a car in the Golden State from abusive surveillance,” said Dave Maass, EFF director of investigations in a prepared statement. In a news release, the EFF called the ALPR system a “mass surveillance technology” and said the vast majority of data is collected on people who are not doing criminal activity. State legislation passed in 2015, Senate Bill 34, included a prohibition of California agencies from sharing this data with non-California agencies. AB 1242, passed with sponsorship from Bonta in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, also involved data protections for those seeking abortions. Questions sent to the media email for the Humboldt County Sherrif’s Office were unanswered by the Times-Standard print deadline. Sage Alexander can be reached at 707-441-0504.

What issues do you think young voters care about as we head into 2024? Climate change? Gun safety? 🗳️ A group of young voters told USA TODAY’s Savannah Kuchar that abortion is the top issue driving them to the polls, even in this year's off-cycle election. In Ohio, voters next week will consider a ballot measure to protect abortion. But even in states where Americans aren’t voting specifically on abortion, it’s still a top campaign message as the country gears up for the 2024 race for the White House. Post-Roe: Aveline Clark, a second-year student at the University of Akron, told USA TODAY she has "spoken to probably a couple hundred people on campus about this issue over the past month or so.” “I can count on one hand how many people responded negatively.” On the other side of the aisle: It’s not just young Democratic voters who told USA TODAY they’re activated by debates over abortion. Sophia Aros, a chair of the Fauquier County Young Republicans in northern Virginia, said some conservatives her age are less on board with the GOP governor's proposed 15-week ban. “This younger generation is understanding the importance of being able to have those rights because it goes farther than just abortion rights. It's bodily autonomy, it's your person, your body,” she said. Read more here: Abortion rights inspire these young voters like no other issue. How they're fighting ahead of 2024. 
2023-11-01	20:30:21+00:00		Senate Democrats work to circumvent Tuberville's blockade on military nominees as vacancies grow	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-11-01/senate-democrats-tuberville-military-nominees	Senate Democrats are trying a new workaround to confirm hundreds of military officers blocked by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, ten months after the Alabama Republican first said he would object to the nominations over a Pentagon abortion policy. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday that the chamber will consider a resolution in the near future that would allow the quick confirmation of the nearly 400 officers up for promotion or nominated for another senior job. The Senate is currently at a stalemate on the nominations because Tuberville is objecting to the routine process of confirming the nominations all at once by unanimous consent, and voting on them individually could monopolize weeks or months of the Senate’s time. Schumer separately moved to hold votes as soon as this week on three top Pentagon officers affected by the holds — Adm. Lisa Franchetti to be the chief of naval operations, Gen. David Allvin to be chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force and Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney to serve as assistant commandant for the U.S. Marine Corps. It’s all about abortion. Sept. 6, 2023 The Senate maneuvers come amid a new war in Israel and as members of both parties are growing increasingly frustrated with Tuberville’s holds. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, had gathered enough signatures to force a vote on Franchetti and Allvin and spoke out in frustration about the issue at the weekly GOP lunch on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with Sullivan’s comments who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said after the lunch that the holds are “a bad idea” and said he’d tried to convince the Alabama Republican to express his opposition some other way. The new efforts to get around Tuberville come after an announcement by the Marine Corps that Gen. Eric Smith, the commandant, has been hospitalized. Smith was confirmed to the top job in September, but had been holding down two high-level posts — commandant and assistant commandant — for several months because Mahoney’s nomination for the No. 2 job has been held up by Tuberville. Smith himself was blunt about the demands of serving as both assistant commandant and acting commandant for months in the wake of Gen. David Berger’s retirement after four years as the top Marine. In public remarks in early September, Smith described his grueling schedule as he juggled the strategic and oversight responsibilities of commandant and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the personnel and management duties of the No. 2 job. “It is not sustainable,” Smith said. “What doesn’t stop is the clock. The adversary doesn’t take a pause.” With Smith hospitalized and no confirmed assistant commandant, Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl is performing the duties of commandant. Heckl, who is the deputy commandant for combat development, can’t serve as an “acting commandant” because he is not currently in a Senate-confirmed position. As a result, he doesn’t have all of the power or authority that a confirmed officer would have. Schumer said Smith’s sudden medical emergency is “precisely the kind of avoidable emergency that Sen. Tuberville has provoked though his reckless holds.” Tuberville has shown no signs of lifting the blockade since he first announced it in February. Despite several high-level vacancies, he has said he will continue to hold up the other nominations unless the Pentagon ends its policy of paying for travel when a service member has to go out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care. The Biden administration instituted the policy after the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion and some states have limited or banned the procedure. The Alabama senator has challenged Schumer to put each individual nomination on the floor, but Democrats have said that could take months to finish and delay other Senate priorities. Democrats have also been hoping to force Tuberville’s hand as the number of stalled nominations has grown. “There’s an old saying in the military, leave no one behind,” Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed said in July. But that strategy has become more difficult as months have passed, and as Tuberville has dug in. “Every day that Sen. Tuberville continues his blanket holds our military preparedness is degraded,” Schumer said. A host of military officers have spoken out about the damage of the delays for service members. While Tuberville’s holds are focused on all general and flag officers, they carry career impacts on the military’s younger rising officers. Until each general or admiral is confirmed, it blocks an opportunity for a more junior officer to rise.
2023-11-01	20:05:32+00:00		Mother, son charged with kidnapping after police say they took a teenager to Oregon for an abortion	https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/3256428/mother-son-charged-with-kidnapping-after-police-say-they-took-a-teenager-to-oregon-for-an-abortion.html	An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son’s minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl’s mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion. With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year. Idaho’s Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren’t relying on it. According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend’s house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho. The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant. According to court documents, the girl said she was “happy” when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship. The boyfriend’s mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to “kick her out of their house” if she did. The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles (885 km) from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl’s cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time. The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was “mutually agreed upon” between the girl and her son. She said she she never “coerced” anyone into having an abortion. Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl. The mother is also facing multiple drug charges. Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.” Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment.

2023-11-01	19:44:37+00:00	Associated Press	Court blasts GOP language on Missouri abortion questions	https://journalrecord.com/2023/11/01/court-blasts-gop-language-on-missouri-abortion-questions/	People rally in support of abortion rights in Kansas City, Mo. A Missouri appeals court on Tuesday ruled against Republican-written summaries that described several abortion-rights amendments as allowing “dangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.” (AP file photo/Charlie Riedel) By: Associated Press//November 1, 2023// COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) – A Missouri appeals court ruled Tuesday against Republican-written summaries of abortion-rights ballot measures that described several proposed amendments as allowing “dangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.” A three-judge panel of the Western District Court of Appeals found the summaries written by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who is running for governor in 2024, are politically partisan. Ballot summaries are used on Missouri ballots to help voters understand sometimes lengthy and complex constitutional amendments and policy changes. Ashcroft’s original description of the amendments, which could go on the ballot in 2024 if supporters gather enough voter signatures, would have asked voters whether they want to “allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.” But the appeals-court panel wrote that allowing unrestricted abortion “during all nine months of pregnancy is not a probable effect of initiatives.” The judges largely upheld summaries that were rewritten by a lower court judge to be more impartial. The summaries approved by the appeals court would tell voters the amendments would “establish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” and “remove Missouri’s ban on abortion.” Ashcroft said he plans to appeal the ruling. Abortion-rights proponents lauded the ruling. “Missourians deserve meaningful access to abortion and the ability to fully participate in the democratic process,” Emily Wales, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood’s Great Plains affiliate, said in a statement. “The court rightfully struck down language that is misleading and stigmatizing.” Missouri is among several states, including Ohio, where abortion opponents are fighting efforts to ensure or restore access to the procedure following the fall of Roe v. Wade last year. A measure to ensure abortion access is on the November ballot in Ohio after withstanding legal challenges from opponents. That state’s voters in August rejected a measure that would have required at least 60% of the vote to amend the state constitution, an approach supported by abortion opponents that would have made it harder to adopt the November ballot question. Measures to protect access already have spots in the 2024 votes in Maryland and New York. Legislative efforts or petition drives are underway in a variety of states. There are efforts to protect or expand access in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and South Dakota; and to restrict it in Iowa, Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Drives are on for both kinds of measures in Colorado. Voters in every state with an abortion-related ballot measure since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, effectively making abortion access a state-by-state question, have favored the side supported by abortion rights supporters. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll earlier this year found that most voters – including those in states with bans on access at all stages of pregnancy – want abortion to be legal early in pregnancy. Most voters also favored some limits. Share this!

2023-11-01	19:44:31+00:00	Tina Sfondeles	J.B. Pritzker’s abortion rights group spends $1.5 million in Ohio, Virginia and Nevada	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/11/1/23942205/jb-pritzker-think-big-america-contributions-ohio-virginia-and-nevada-1-5-million	Gov. J.B. Pritzker addresses an abortion rights rally at Federal Plaza last year. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s newly created nonprofit to combat anti-abortion efforts has already contributed $1.5 million to the movement, including a share in the next big abortion rights battleground state: Virginia. Think Big America’s contribution of $25,000 each to four state Senate Democratic candidates in Virginia, and an additional $150,000 to the state Democratic party, comes ahead of a pivotal Nov. 7 election that may reshape abortion restrictions in the state. While Pritzker’s group is aimed at helping states fight their own battles, abortion ballot questions will also likely boost Democratic turnout in next year’s presidential election. In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said he would support an abortion ban after 15 weeks should Republicans win full control of the state legislature in next week’s elections. Republicans hope to hold the state’s House of Delegates and and flip the Senate. Think Big America contributed $25,000 each to state Delegates Danica Roem, Schuyler VanValkenburg, Russet Perry and Joel Griffin. Christina Amestoy, spokeswoman for Think Big America, called the contribution an example of “fighting extremism at every level.” “Abortion access is on the line in Virginia. Given the chance, anti-choice extremists and their far-right allies will roll back reproductive freedoms in the last state in the South where women’s freedoms are still protected,” Amestoy said in a statement. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, Pritzker and the Democrat-led Illinois General Assembly have expanded abortion rights in Illinois. Furthering that goal, Pritzker announced last month the launch of Think Big America, a tax-exempt nonprofit that spends money and resources to protect and expand abortion rights throughout the country. The billionaire governor is contributing dollars to initially seed the group, although he declined to specify the amount. And the group won’t be required to disclose its donors. In Nevada, Think Big America also contributed $1 million to the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom PAC, which is fighting for a November 2024 ballot question that would establish a “fundamental right to reproductive rights.” The newly formed PAC is affiliated with Planned Parenthood. In Ohio, Think Big America contributed $250,000 to Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, a ballot committee made up of a coalition of reproductive rights advocates. Ohioans on Nov. 7 will be voting whether to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitution. Abortion rights advocates in August defeated a ballot initiative in Ohio that would have raised the threshold to change the constitution from a simple majority to 60%, a measure that if approved would have made it harder to protect abortion rights in the state. Now proponents who went out asking for a “no” vote on the August amendment are asking for a “yes” to codify abortion rights in the state, which has caused some confusion. Pritzker has already contributed $750,000 individually to support the abortion rights initiative: $500,000 in September to Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights and $250,000 in June to Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, records show. In addition to the latest contributions through the group, Pritzker also contributed $201,000 to two groups in support of Kansas’ abortion amendment last year. He also sent $1 million to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and $20,000 directly to Janet for Justice to support Janet Protasiewicz, the Milwaukee County judge who won her Wisconsin Supreme Court justice seat and flipped control of the court to give liberals a 4-3 majority. Pritzker’s political staffers are splitting their time between his campaign and Think Big America. The Democratic governor sent some of his staff, including his campaign manager, to Ohio this year to help Democrats defeat the August ballot initiative. For now, there are no plans for any staffers to be on the ground for the final stretch of the Ohio vote, Amestoy said. Think Big America, however, plans to post social media links where can people can sign up to make calls.
2023-11-01	17:11:00+00:00	Ariana Baio	An Idaho teenager and his mother are facing charges over a 15-year-old’s abortion	https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/abortion-idaho-teenager-charges-b2439729.html	Kadyn Swainston, 18, and his mother Rachael Swainston arrested on felony charges including kidnapping An 18-year-old boy and his mother are facing various felony charges in Idaho, including kidnapping, after allegedly helping a 15-year-old girl obtain an abortion out-of-state without her parents’ permission. Kadyn Swainston, 18, and Rachael Swainston, 42, of Pocatello, Idaho, were arrested in late October following a months-long investigation into a 15-year-old girl who was reported to have been raped and then taken across state lines to receive an abortion, according to records seen by the Idaho State Journal. Mr Swainston was charged with second-degree kidnapping, rape and three counts of child sexually explicit materials. His mother, Ms Swainston, was also charged with second-degree kidnapping as well as other felonies. The case and charges come just months after Idaho enacted a law that prohibits adults from helping a minor obtain an abortion without parental consent – nicknamed “abortion trafficking.” Though neither Mr Swainston nor his mother are charged under the state’s “abortion trafficking” law, which is currently being challenged, the kidnapping charges mirror language used in the law. The details of the case are muddy and paint a picture of how Idaho’s anti-abortion laws have impacted everyday citizens. In June, the 15-year-old girl’s mother contacted police to report that Mr Swainston had raped her daughter, who subsequently became pregnant. However, when the girl was interviewed in August at a local child advocacy center, she told authorities the relationship between her and Mr Swainston was consensual and they engaged in sexual relations when he was 17 but it continued after he turned 18. According to court documents seen by The Guardian, the teenage girl had been living at the Swainstons’ residence – though she was meant to be living with her father. Mr Swainston made similar statements to police in a separate interview, according to The Idaho State Journal. The girl reportedly told investigators that she discovered she was pregnant around Mr Swainston’s 18 birthday and was “happy”. She allegedly claimed that Mr Swainston insisted she get an abortion, or else he would not pay child support nor continue their relationship. The teenage girl’s mother reported to authorities that, without her permission, Mr Swainston and his mother drove her daughter to Bend, Oregon, where she obtained an abortion. The girl told police that Ms Swainston rented a car and travelled with her and Mr Swainston to an abortion clinic in May for the procedure. When police secured search warrants for the girl’s cellphone they found phone records that matched the travel dates and locations as well as an explicit video and photos of the girl engaging in sexual activity with Mr Swainston. While searching the home where Mr Swainston and his mother lived, they allegedly discovered Ms Swainston had over 40 grams of meth as well as fentanyl and psychedelic mushrooms and found a man, wanted for arrest, who was staying in Ms Swainston’s shed. Ms Swainston was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance, one count of drug trafficking and one count of accessory to willfully withhold, conceal or harbour a felon. The mother and son are set to appear at preliminary trial hearings on 7 November. While the charges in this case are not directly related to Idaho’s “abortion trafficking” law, it has heightened attention on the legislation due to the nature of the allegations. In May, Idaho became the first state in the nation to enact such a law aimed at preventing minors from seeking abortions or obtaining abortion medication out of state. It was enacted nearly a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade which triggered anti-abortion laws in the state that immediately outlawed abortions in nearly all cases except in rape or incest – so long as there is a police report associated with the exceptions. The law also gives sole discretion to the Idaho attorney general to bring charges against an adult should a county prosecutor decline to do so. The so-called “abortion trafficking” law was challenged by advocacy groups Northwest Abortion Access Fund, Indigenous Idaho Alliance and individual plaintiff Lourdes Matsumoto who believe the law violates a person’s right to interstate travel and that it infringes on the First Amendment. The challenge to Idaho’s law is still playing out in district court.

2023-11-01	17:03:10+00:00		As vacancies grow, Senate Democrats work to circumvent Tuberville’s blockade on military nominees	https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/general-election/3256305/as-vacancies-grow-senate-democrats-work-to-circumvent-tubervilles-blockade-on-military-nominees.html	WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican senators angrily challenged Sen. Tommy Tuberville on his blockade of almost 400 military officers Wednesday evening, taking over the Senate floor for more than four hours to call for individual confirmation votes after a monthslong stalemate. Tuberville, R-Ala., stood and objected to each nominee — 61 times total, when the night was over — extending his holds on the military confirmations and promotions with no immediate resolution in sight. But the extraordinary confrontation between Republicans, boiling over almost nine months after Tuberville first announced the holds over a Pentagon abortion policy, escalated the standoff as Defense Department officials have repeatedly said the backlog of officials needing confirmation could endanger national security. “Why are we putting holds on war heroes?” asked Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, himself a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. “I don’t understand.” Wrapping up for the night at almost 11 p.m., Sullivan said the senators will keep returning to the floor to call up nominations. If the standoff continues and officers leave the military, he said, Tuberville’s blockade will be remembered as a “national security suicide mission.” South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham told Tuberville, who mostly sat quiet and alone as they talked, that he should sue the military if he thinks the policy is illegal. “That’s how you handle these things,” Graham said. After Tuberville objected to a vote on a two-star general nominated to be a deputy commander in the Air Force, Graham turned and faced him. “You just denied this lady a promotion,” Graham said angrily to Tuberville. “You did that.” Tuberville said Wednesday there is “zero chance” he will drop the holds. Despite several high-level vacancies and the growing backlog of nominations, he has said he will continue to hold the nominees up unless the Pentagon ends — or puts to a vote in Congress — its new policy of paying for travel when a service member has to go out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care. President Joe Biden’s administration instituted the policy after the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, and some states have limited or banned the procedure. “I cannot simply sit idly by while the Biden administration injects politics in our military from the White House and spends taxpayers’ dollars on abortion,” Tuberville said. Showing obvious frustration and frequent flashes of anger, the Republican senators — Sullivan, Graham, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, Indiana Sen. Todd Young and others — read lengthy biographies and praised individual nominees as they called for vote after vote. They said they agree with Tuberville on the policy, but questioned — as Democrats have for months — why he would hold up the highest ranks of the U.S. military. Sullivan said Tuberville is “100 percent wrong” that his holds are not affecting military readiness. Ernst said the nominees are being used as “political pawns.” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney advised Tuberville to try to negotiate an end to the standoff. All of them warned that good people would leave military service if the blockade continues. As the night wore on, Sullivan and Ernst — herself a former commander in the U.S. Army Reserve and Iowa Army National Guard — continued to bring up new nominations and appeared to become increasingly frustrated. They noted that they were bringing up the nominations “one by one” as Tuberville had once called for, and asked why he wouldn’t allow them to go forward. Tuberville did not answer. “I do not respect men who do not honor their word,” Ernst said at one point. Sullivan said “China is smiling” as the United States blocks its own military heroes. “As an American, it almost wants to make you weep.” The GOP effort to move the nominations came after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday morning they are trying a new workaround to confirm the officers. Schumer said the Senate will consider a resolution in the near future that would allow the quick confirmation of the now nearly 400 officers up for promotion or nominated for another senior job. The resolution by Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would tweak the rules until the end of this session of Congress next year to allow a process for the Senate to pass multiple military nominations together. It would not apply to other nominations. To go into effect, the Senate Rules Committee will have to consider the temporary rules change and send it to the Senate floor, where the full Senate would have to vote to approve it. That process could take several weeks and would likely need Republican support to succeed. “Patience is wearing thin with Senator Tuberville on both sides of the aisle,” Schumer said. Schumer separately moved to hold confirmation votes as soon as Thursday on three top Pentagon officers affected by the holds — Adm. Lisa Franchetti to be the chief of naval operations, Gen. David Allvin to be chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force and Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney to serve as assistant commandant for the U.S. Marine Corps. Sullivan had gathered enough signatures to force a vote on Franchetti and Allvin and spoke out in frustration about the issue at the weekly GOP lunch on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with Sullivan’s comments who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has also criticized the holds, saying on Tuesday that they are “a bad idea” and he’d tried to convince the Alabama Republican to express his opposition some other way. Tuberville said earlier on Wednesday he disagrees with the Democratic effort to try to get around his hold and and pass the nominations in large groups, arguing that the workaround would “burn the city down” and take away one of the only powers that the minority party has. The new efforts to move the nominations come after the Marine Corps said that Gen. Eric Smith, the commandant, was hospitalized on Sunday after “suffering a medical condition” at his official residence in Washington. Smith, who is currently listed in stable condition and is recovering, was confirmed to the top job last month, but had been holding down two high-level posts for several months because of Tuberville’s holds. Smith himself was blunt about the demands of serving as both assistant commandant and acting commandant for months in the wake of Gen. David Berger’s retirement after four years as the top Marine. In public remarks in early September, Smith described his grueling schedule as he juggled the strategic and oversight responsibilities of commandant and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the personnel and management duties of the No. 2 job. “It is not sustainable,” Smith said. “What doesn’t stop is the clock. The adversary doesn’t take a pause.” When Schumer announced the vote this week on Mahoney’s nomination to be assistant commandant, he said Smith’s sudden medical emergency is “precisely the kind of avoidable emergency that Sen. Tuberville has provoked through his reckless holds.” Tuberville has challenged Schumer to put each individual nomination on the floor. But Democrats have been hoping to force Tuberville’s hand as the number of stalled nominations has grown. “There’s an old saying in the military, leave no one behind,” Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed said in July. That strategy has become more difficult as months have passed, and as Tuberville has dug in. In September, Schumer relented and allowed confirmation votes on three of the Pentagon’s top officials: Gen. CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Randy George, Army Chief of Staff, and Smith as commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.

2023-11-01	16:28:22+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	'Very unusual': Financial disclosures reveal Mike Johnson 'does not have a bank account' or investments	https://www.alternet.org/mike-johnson-s-disclosures-raise-questions-about-his-financial-wellbeing-report/	Although House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has been served in the U.S. House of Representatives since January 2017, he had a relatively low profile until recently. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) even said that she needed to Google him after House Republicans nominated him for the position. Now that the 51-year-old Johnson is speaker, reporters and politicians who didn't pay a lot of attention to him before are researching his history — especially his activities as a far-right Christian fundamentalist and his commitment to Christian nationalist ideology. Johnson's anti-gay, anti-abortion history has been receiving a great deal of scrutiny from journalists. But the Daily Beast's Roger Sollenberger, in a report published on November 1, focuses on another aspect of the House speaker's history: his finances. POLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again? "Newly elected Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) does not have a bank account," Sollenberger reports. "At least, that's what Johnson reports on years of personal financial disclosures, which date back to 2016 and reveal a financial life that, in the context of his role as a congressman and now speaker, appears extraordinarily precarious. Over the course of seven years, Johnson has never reported a checking or savings account in his name, nor in the name of his wife or any of his children, disclosures show." Sollenberger continues, "In fact, he doesn't appear to have money stashed in any investments, with his latest filing — covering 2022 — showing no assets whatsoever. Of course, it's unlikely Johnson doesn't actually have a bank account. What's more likely is Johnson lives paycheck to paycheck — so much so that he doesn't have enough money in his bank account to trigger the checking account disclosure rules for members of Congress." Harmond Curran's Brett Kappel, a government ethics expert, told the Beast that it would be "very unusual for a member" of Congress "not to have to disclose at least one bank account." Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), argues that if Johnson lacks assets despite earning a congressman's salary, it "raises questions about his personal financial wellbeing." Libowitz told the Beast, "It's strange to see Speaker Johnson disclose no assets. He made over $200,000 last year, and his wife took home salary from two employers as well. So, why isn't there a bank account or any form of savings listed?.... He owes hundreds of thousands of dollars between a mortgage, personal loan, and home equity line of credit. So, where did that money go?” Read The Daily Beast's full report at this link (subscription required).

And when Republicans have a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, they typically push religious right causes like abortion and school prayer. But the New York Times' Thomas Edsall, in an essay/op-ed published by the New York Times on November 1, warns that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) is especially extreme when it comes to pushing far-right "Christian nationalist" ideology. "Mike Johnson is the first person to become speaker of the House who can be fairly described as a Christian nationalist — a major development in American history in and of itself," Edsall explains. "Equally important, however, his ascension reflects the strength of white evangelical voters' influence on the House Republican caucus — =voters who are determined to use the power of government to roll back the civil rights, women's rights and sexual revolutions." POLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again? Public Religion Research Institute President Robert Jones considers Johnson "the embodiment of white Christian nationalism in a tailored suit." Jones told the Times, "While Johnson is more polished than other right-wing leaders of the GOP who support this worldview, his record and previous public statements indicate that he's a near-textbook example of white Christian nationalism — the belief that God intended America to be a new promised land for European Christians." Michael Podhorzer, former political director of the AFL-CIO, is warning that Christian nationalists are determined to purge the GOP of anyone who rejects their ideology. In a Substack article published on October 29, Podhorzer wrote, "From 2010 through 2022, a historically high number of House Republicans were defeated in primaries, with the vast majority of successful challenges happening in the most evangelical districts…. Mike Johnson becoming speaker is better understood in terms of the ongoing white Christian nationalist takeover of the American government through MAGA." Philip Gorski, a sociologist at Yale University in Connecticut, told the Times, "Johnson says out loud what most others just feel: that America was founded as a Christian nation; that the founders were 'evangelical' Christians; that the founding documents were based on 'biblical principles'; that God has entrusted America with a divine mission; that He has blessed America with unique power and prosperity; and that those blessings will be withdrawn if America strays off the straight and narrow path of Christian morality. And that it is every good Christian's duty to make America Christian again." Read The New York Times' full report at this link (subscription required).

Mr Tuberville spoke on Fox News with Laura Ingraham on Tuesday evening. “We’re in a tough time right now because our military’s struggling to actually put a group together, whether it’s Army, Navy, Air Force” he said. Mr Tuberville, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has placed a blanket hold on more than 300 military promotions in protest of a policy by the Pentagon that reimburses US servicemembers if they travel to seek an abortion in a state where it is more accessible. The hold has led to a backlog of more than 300 promotions. Earlier this week, Gen Eric Smith, the commandant for the US Marine Corps, was hospitalised, which meant that a three-star officer was now in charge of the branch, Military.com reported. Mr Tuberville has in turn hoped to force a vote on Lt Gen Christopher Mahoney, whom President Joe Biden nominated to be assistant commandant to Gen Smith. The blanket hold Mr Tuberville put in place meant that Gen Smith essentially had to fulfill duties of both positions. In September, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer held a vote and allowed for the confirmation of three generals to be members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Gen Smith, Gen CQ Brown to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Randy Smith to be Army Chief of Staff. During the confirmation hearing for Admiral Lisa Franchetti, Mr Biden’s nominee to be the top officer for the US Navy, she articulated the impact of Mr Tuberville’s hold. “I think just at the three-star level it would take about three to four months to move all of the people around but it will take years to recover from their promotion, if confirmed, from the promotion delays for years to come,” Adm Franchetti said at the time. Mr Tuberville has shown little indication of backing down.

2023-11-01	14:50:39+00:00		U.S. bishops object to inclusion of abortion in proposed federal sexual harassment guidance	https://catholicreview.org/u-s-bishops-object-to-inclusion-of-abortion-in-proposed-federal-sexual-harassment-guidance/	 November 1, 2023By Kate Scanlon OSV News Filed Under: Bishops, Feature, News, Respect Life, World News WASHINGTON (OSV News) — A rule proposed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, “Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace,” would govern the implementation of federal law on harassment and associated nondiscrimination policies. However, the U.S. Catholic bishops and other religious organizations have argued that the way the rule defines “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions” to include abortion could result in pro-life views leading to a harassment charge. The proposed guidance on workplace harassment seeks to protect employees from harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age or genetic information, according to the Biden administration and the EEOC. The rule, published for public inspection Oct. 2, states that “sex-based harassment” also includes harassment based on “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions” which it defines as inclusive of “current pregnancy, past pregnancy, potential pregnancy, lactation (including breastfeeding and pumping), use of birth control, menstruation, infertility and fertility treatments, endometriosis, miscarriage, stillbirth, or having or choosing not to have an abortion, among other conditions.” EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows said in a Sept. 29 statement announcing the proposed guidance that “preventing and addressing harassment in America’s workplaces has long been a key priority for the EEOC, and this guidance will provide clarity on new developments in the law and build on the Commission’s previous work.” “The Commission looks forward to receiving public input on the proposed enforcement guidance,” Burrows said. In an Oct. 27 letter to the EEOC, representatives of the bishops’ conference argued that “references to abortion in the harassment guidance are problematic and should be removed.” “Opposition to abortion (including speech opposing abortion) is not sexual harassment because it is not based on sex,” the letter said. “We encourage speech on abortion and other moral issues that is respectful, courteous, and constructive,” it said. “It is reasonable for employers and employees to insist upon civility and non-disruption in the workplace as a general matter. But on issues that involve no protected category, such as abortion, Title VII itself is silent and therefore has no role.” In a message to its supporters, the USCCB urged the public to comment in opposition to the rule. The comment period was to close Nov. 1. “It is good that we have laws prohibiting harassment in the workplace,” the bishops’ message said. “But speech expressing moral opposition to abortion, contraception, or same-sex unions, or speech that refers to people by their actual sex, is not harassment.”

J.B. Pritzker of Illinois is giving $250,000 to Virginia Democrats ahead of November’s legislative elections that will determine the balance of power in the state, NBC News reported Wednesday. Think Big America is contributing $25,000 each to Democrats running in some of Virginia’s swing districts for the state Senate — Danica Roem, Schuyler Van Valkenburg, Russet Perry and Joel Griffin, according to NBC News. Virginia’s Democratic Party will also receive $150,000 from the group ahead of the Nov. 7 election where all of the state’s 140 legislative seats will be on the ballot, which the nonprofit argues could determine the future of abortion access in the state. (RELATED: Republican Governor In Key State Breaks Fundraising Record Ahead Of Election Day) “Abortion access is on the line in Virginia. Given the chance, anti-choice extremists and their far-right allies will roll back reproductive freedoms in the last state in the south where women’s freedoms are still protected,” Christina Amestoy, spokesperson for the nonprofit, told NBC News. “Think Big America is committed to fighting extremism at every level and will always work to defend a woman’s right to choose.” Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has been campaigning across the state through his Spirit of Virginia political action committee (PAC) in hopes of holding the House of Delegates and flipping the Senate. If Youngkin is successful, the GOP would control all of the state’s government, which Democrats worry could allow Republicans to pass a 15-week abortion ban, leading them to campaign on the issue, according to NBC News. The nonprofit has also given to pro-abortion groups in both Ohio and Nevada, where the former will vote on a ballot measure in November to add a constitutional amendment for a right to the procedure and the latter could see a similar initiative in 2024, according to NBC News. STAFFORD, VIRGINIA – OCTOBER 28: Republican U.S. House nominee Yesli Vega (R) listens to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (L) during a campaign rally. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) Youngkin’s PAC announced on Oct. 4 that it had raised a record-breaking $7.45 million during the year’s third fundraising quarter, bringing the group’s total to $15.5 million since March to support the Republican candidates. The Democratic National Committee has spent $1.5 million on Virginia’s legislative elections, largely at the directive of President Joe Biden. A Founders Insight poll released Oct. 9 found the legislative elections are in a dead heat, with 45% of likely voters supporting the Democrats, 44% supporting the Republicans and 11% remaining undecided for a generic General Assembly ballot.

2023-11-01	12:00:21+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/charles-mcnulty	Abortion bans make 2023 America feel even more like ‘Spring Awakening’s’ 19th century Germany	https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-11-01/abortion-bans-2023-america-spring-awakening-musical-east-west-players	Since winning the 2007 Tony Award for best musical, “Spring Awakening” has only grown more excruciatingly relevant. Book bans in schools censoring anything that might shed light on the variety of human sexual expression and experience are gaining momentum. Attacks on reproductive freedom and care have made the lives of young people all the more dangerous. In the show, a back-alley abortion leads to tragedy, and the scene, which once seemed to belong to the pages of history, could now be a headline on social media. Progress isn’t linear, not with the forces of conservative morality hard at work to turn back the clock. Still, it was startling to encounter “Spring Awakening” at East West Players’ David Henry Hwang Theater and think that our society has moved closer to the benighted social world of a show set in late 19th century provincial Germany. Derived from Frank Wedekind’s play of the same title, Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik’s “Spring Awakening” is part concert, part drama, part secular mass. To the moody strains of Sheik’s alt-rock score, the vise of adolescence is captured in a story about pubescent youths rebelling against the warping will of adult hypocrisy and repression. How East West Players’ staging of ‘Spring Awakening’ makes the groundbreaking musical even more transgressive. Plus more highlights of the week in arts Oct. 21, 2023 Former EWP artistic director Tim Dang returns to direct a revival that Snehal Desai had programmed and was slated to direct before he was appointed Center Theatre Group’s new artistic leader. Dang uses the occasion as an opportunity to showcase a new generation of talent on the theater’s mainstage. Inexperience is sometimes in evidence in a cast that too often translates intensity into over-emphatic acting. The staging lacks stylistic control. (Visually, the production seems scattershot.) The adults, played by Daniel Blinkoff and Tamlyn Tomita, work in caricatures that in Blinkoff’s case seem like stock villains from musty melodrama. But the revolutionary force of nature coursing through teenage bodies that refuse to be suppressed is powerfully brought to life. Dang and his cast don’t pull any punches. Prudes are going to be prudish, so no point in trying to appease them in a show that’s all about the havoc that’s wrought when human biology is denied by moralistic zealots. Two performances leave lasting impressions: Mia Sempertegui as Wendla and Thomas Winter as Melchior, the young lovers whose tragedy could have been averted if only grownups wouldn’t enforce ignorance over common-sense enlightenment. The haunting story of this innocent couple fills the stage with a sacrificial gravity that feels disturbingly relevant to 2023 America. Where: East West Players’ David Henry Hwang Theater at the Union Center of the Arts, 120 Judge John Aiso St., Los AngelesWhen: 8 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays, Mondays, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, 5 p.m. Sundays.

2023-11-01	11:02:10+00:00	John Lavenburg	Ahead of key abortion vote, Ohio archdiocese reports growing vandalism	https://catholicherald.co.uk/ahead-of-key-abortion-vote-ohio-archdiocese-reports-growing-vandalism/	NEW YORK – Ahead of a important abortion vote in Ohio, the Archdiocese of Cincinnati says there have been multiple incidents of vandalism, including thefts of yard signs opposing the pro-abortion measure, at archdiocesan schools, churches and cemeteries. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati, and other Ohio Catholic dioceses, have consistently opposed “Issue 1,” which is on the ballot on Nov. 7, and which, if approved, would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. On Oct. 31, the Archdiocese of Cincinnati announced that more than a dozen archdiocesan properties reported vandalisms or thefts related to their opposition to Issue 1. According to the archdiocese, Incarnation Catholic Church in Centerville was vandalized on Oct. 18 when the front door window of the church was spray painted to cover a sign opposing Issue 1 posted on the interior of the window. At least four other parishes had multiple “vote no” yard signs vandalized or stolen as well. There were also more than a dozen other church properties, Catholic high schools and cemeteries that have reported thefts of “vote no” yard signs, the archdiocese said. In response, Archbishop Dennis Schnurr of Cincinnati said he is grateful to archdiocesan leaders who have remained “steadfast” in their opposition to the ballot measure. “I am grateful to all our priests and other parish and school leaders who have maintained steadfast opposition to Issue 1 despite the many challenges presented, including theft and vandalism,” Schnurr told Crux in a statement. “We remain committed to the protection of and care for women, children and families regardless of the outcome of this election,” Schnurr said. In October, Ohio voters rejected a different ballot measure, also called Issue 1, which would have made it more difficult to change the state’s constitution by requiring a 60 percent supermajority threshold for constitutional amendments, as opposed to the current simple majority. Because voters knew the other Issue 1 vote was around the corner, many viewed the amendment’s rejection as a proxy vote for the abortion measure, in the sense that approving it would make it harder to pass the abortion amendment and vice-versa. At the time, Brian Hickey, executive director of the Ohio Catholic Conference, disagreed, telling Crux that “we certainly did not see it as a pure proxy vote,” and that they don’t view defeating the abortion measure on November 7 as “an impossible task. If the abortion measure were to pass, it would put the state’s six-week abortion ban in limbo. Proponents of Issue 1 argue that the constitutional amendment ensures people can make the best decisions for themselves and their families, protecting patients and families from extreme abortion bans, and preventing the government from jailing patients who seek abortion or miscarriage care and doctors who provide that care. “Vote YES to keep the government out of our family’s personal decisions,” an official readout states. “Ohioans agree that abortion is a personal, private decision that should be up to women and their families, not the government.” Conversely, according to the readout, opponents of Issue 1 argue that the amendment establishes abortion-on-demand through all nine months or pregnancy, erases parental rights by not requiring parental notification for abortions and other procedures, and eliminates health and safety protections for women by abolishing the requirement that abortions must be performed in-person by a licensed doctor. “Issue 1 is a dangerous attack on the unborn, women, and parents,” the readout states.

Isabel Vaughan-Spruce was fined in Birmingham on 18 October despite being twice vindicated after previous arrests for praying silently in abortion clinic buffer zones. In both cases, the charges were dropped. The buffer zone criminalises prayer, offering women information or assistance, and any "expression of approval or disapproval of abortion" within a 150m radius of the clinic. According to the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF UK), which is supporting Vaughan-Spruce, the police community support officer asked if she was silently praying for "unborn children" and whether she was a member of a pro-life or pro-choice organisation. Commenting on the latest incident, Ms Vaughan-Spruce said, "The UK government urgently needs to clarify that silent thoughts can never be illegal â even if those thoughts are in disagreement with the views of the state. "This is the third time I have been treated like a criminal for peacefully, silently, and imperceptibly praying for women who are likely facing one of the worst days of their lives. "The buffer zone regulation has already sought to prevent me and others from counselling women desperately in need of help. And now, authorities are trying to remove my ability even to pray for these women. "To fine somebody simply for their thoughts is grossly Orwellian and an insult to the freedoms that Britain is meant to protect." Days earlier another Christian, Patrick Parkes, was warned by officers at the same location that he would be fined if he continued to pray silently, and a third individual received a warning for filming the incident. ADF UK questioned the police's priorities after it was reported in AugustÂ that Birmingham had overtaken London as the gun capital of the UK, with firearmsÂ offences in the region soaring 86 per cent.Â In September, Birmingham Council declared itself bankrupt. Any prosecutions for silent prayer in buffer zones would have to be funded by the council.Â 
2023-11-01	07:45:00+00:00		Supreme Court issued ruling invalidating 1990 abortion ban	https://www.kuam.com/story/49927284/supreme-court-issued-ruling-invalidating-1990-abortion-ban	The Guam Supreme Court has issued a ruling essentially invalidating the 1990 law banning abortion on Guam. Governor Lou Leon Guerrero had sought it's opinion after the federal 9th Circuit Court lifted a longstanding Guam District Court injunction against the abortion ban shortly after it was signed 23 years ago. A Judiciary news release states that Chief Justice Phillip Carbullido sided with the governor, finding that since Roe v. Wade was the prevailing law of the land in 1990, the Guam law was inherently void, and the Guam Legislature had exceeded its authority in passing it. Justice Carbullido further holds that the invalidation cannot be changed by subsequent shifts in legal interpretation, and that any changes to Guam's abortion policy should come from the legislature. Last june the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the landmark Roe v. Wade case, returning jurisdiction of abortion laws to individual states and territories. The 1990 Guam abortion law had called for an islandwide referendum to decide the issue, but it was never held because the Guam District Court issued a permanent injunction against the abortion law.
2023-11-01	07:09:30+00:00	By										Renee Romo | Cronkite News	Physicians can challenge genetic-abnormality abortion ban, court rules – Cronkite News	https://prescottenews.com/index.php/2023/11/01/physicians-can-challenge-genetic-abnormality-abortion-ban-court-rules-cronkite-news/	Photo: Abortion law in Arizona, as in much of the country, has been in turmoil since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the 50-year-old decision recognizing a right to an abortion. Despite that, a federal appeals court said this week that a group of doctors in Arizona can sue to block a state law banning abortions on the basis of genetic abnormalities. (File photo by Troy Hill/Cronkite News) A federal appeals court said a group of Arizona physicians can challenge the state’s ban on abortions for genetic abnormalities, a law the doctors say could land them in jail because it is impermissibly vague. The ruling Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a lower court that had dismissed the suit, saying the physicians did not have standing to sue after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion that was recognized in Roe v. Wade. But the circuit court said the physicians can sue. It agreed that the doctors have been harmed by the law, the so-called Reason Regulations, because they are “over-complying with the laws because it is unclear what conduct falls within the laws’ grasp.” “Plaintiffs declared an intention to perform abortions up to the legal limits of the Reason Regulations but … because those limits are unclear, many abortions they would otherwise perform could be deemed violations of the statute,” Circuit Judge Ronald Gould wrote. Gould said the doctors have standing to sue “based on their economic interest in providing medical services,” services that have been curtailed by the law. “We are glad that the 9th Circuit has recognized that we deserve to have our day in court. To say otherwise would have been an egregious failure of the justice system,” Jessica Sklarsky, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. The center represented the physicians, the Arizona Medical Association, the Arizona chapter of the National Organization for Women and the National Council of Jewish Women in the suit to block the 2021 law. But Erin Hawley of the Alliance Defending Freedom said in a statement she looks forward to defending the law when it returns to district court. “The abortion industry is using this case to push for and profit from abortions targeting children for their genetic makeup, physical appearance, and other inherent immutable traits,” said Hawley, the vice president of the alliances’ Center for Life and Regulatory Practice. Arizona is one of just eight states that ban abortions on the basis of genetic abnormality, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The law, passed in 2021, makes it a felony to perform an abortion “solely because of genetic abnormalities in the fetus or embryo.” In addition to jail time, doctors convicted under the law could lose their medical license, and could be sued for civil damages by the father in such a case. Sklarsky said her center, along with the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Arizona, sued to block the law because it violated “the substantive due process right to abortion” that was in place at the time. Their suit said the law also violated physicians’ constitutional right to due process because it was “impermissibly vague.” The district court granted a preliminary injunction. Then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich appealed and was rejected by the circuit court. But the U.S. Supreme Court, which had just issued its Dobbs decision, that overturned Roe, ordered the district court to reconsider the case in light of its ruling in Dobbs. This time, the district court let the law take effect, saying that without Roe, the plaintiffs did not have standing to block the law. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, who took office in January, has declined to enforce the law or defend it in court, but Republican leaders in the Arizona Legislature stepped in to defend it on its second trip to the 9th Circuit. After oral arguments in September, Sklarsky said that “abortion providers are being treated differently from all other litigants and effectively are having the courthouse doors slammed in their faces.” Monday’s ruling gives them the chance to make their case again. Both Sklarsky and Hawley said they look forward to taking the case back to district court to argue the merits. But Dianne Post, attorney and legislative coordinator for Arizona NOW, said the case never should have had to go to the appellate court in the first place. “The decision from the district judge was so obviously incorrect that we never should have had to go,” Post said Tuesday. “I can’t make predictions because our courts are so destroyed by the previous administration,” Post said. “Facts and truth don’t seem to matter in court any more than they matter in politics.” Your email address will not be published.

The highlights this week: The U.N. warns of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Congo, Sudan’s RSF rebels take Nyala, and South Africa celebrates another Rugby World Cup win. The Most Successful U.S. International Health Policy Is Unraveling Fierce opposition from conservative lawmakers is casting doubt on the future of PEPFAR, the U.S. government’s most successful global-health program, which was set up two decades ago by the George W. Bush administration to address the HIV epidemic. Since 2003, PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, has funded antiretroviral treatment for more than 20 million people across more than 50 countries in its 20-year existence. The project has donated about $110 billion to health projects globally, yet a decision to fund the program’s next five-year cycle has become embroiled in the domestic abortion debate. Authorization for PEPFAR lapsed at the end of September after it failed to get congressional approval. This moves the program to an annual rather than a five-year cycle and cuts requirements that 10 percent of PEPFAR funding go directly to orphans and other children affected by HIV. Some conservative groups and Republican lawmakers argue that U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has “hijacked” the initiative “to promote abortion” overseas. Republican complaints about PEPFAR focus on the Biden administration’s 2021 decision to end the so-called Mexico City policy, also known by critics as the “global gag rule,” which cut U.S. government funding to any organizations deemed to promote abortion. Many conservatives argue that PEPFAR should be subject to the Mexico City policy. In a statement, Rep. Chris Smith, chair of the House global health subcommittee, cited a letter signed by 131 African religious leaders and lawmakers in countries with some of the harshest laws around abortion including Nigeria and Uganda. Quoting the letter, he urged that PEPFAR “not cross over into promoting divisive ideas and practices that are not consistent with those of Africa.” Yet there is no consensus coming from Africa on restricting PEPFAR. In September, more than 350 African church leaders asked for PEPFAR to be reauthorized. They wrote that the assertions that PEPFAR was being used in Africa to fund or promote abortion were “unfounded and grossly unfortunate” and that they were “not aware of any such instance.” African civil society groups argue that, given the restrictive abortion laws in many African nations, the chances of PEPFAR money being used to fund or promote abortion in those states are slim to none. Around 35 percent of PEPFAR funding in Uganda goes to civil society organizations—many of which are faith-based or affiliated with U.S. evangelical institutions. The region has one of the highest rates of unsanctioned backstreet abortions in the world due to its prohibitive laws. Lobbying by U.S.-based evangelical groups in the country has also led to restrictions on condom access, a higher burden of unwanted pregnancies, and, according to a 2021 report by the British Medical Journal, a lack of preparedness by health facilities to treat abortion complications, leading to increased maternal deaths. In 2022, the U.S. government allocated $618.2 million toward health programs in Nigeria. Research conducted by Fòs Feminista, a global alliance that advocates for sexual and reproductive rights, argues that the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade had been weaponized by local lawmakers in Kenya and Nigeria to push back on reforms. Respondents in Nigeria told Fòs Feminista the U.S. change had strengthened those opposed to LGBT rights and women’s rights in the country. PEPFAR advocates point out that the presence of HIV has decreased dramatically among children in South Africa in part due to the program’s funding. South Africa has the world’s largest number of people infected with HIV, accounting for about 13 percent of its population of 62 million, and those dependent on PEPFAR funding fear losing access to treatment. Importantly, a $45 million project to find a breakthrough HIV vaccine is also awaiting reauthorization. The five-year PEPFAR-funded project led by South Africa’s Medical Research Council partners with scientists from eight African countries including Uganda and Nigeria to conduct an HIV vaccine study based on the two most common types of HIV found in Africa. “Consider the impact of this work being led from right here in South Africa,” wrote U.S. Agency for International Development Deputy Administrator Paloma Adams-Allen.

The regulator said it had received complaints that the reporting undermined the Egyptian government’s official policy of refusing to accept Palestinian refugees because of the potential for permanent displacement. “Not a single Egyptian official has spoken about the displacement, which Egypt rejects altogether,” it added. (Egypt accepted 81 critically-injured Palestinians on Tuesday according to the Palestinian border authority.) Mada Masr has frequently come under fire from authorities in a crackdown on press freedom. According to Human Rights Watch, since 2017, authorities have blocked access to Mada Masr’s website in Egypt along with hundreds of other websites. DRC humanitarian crisis. The U.N. says nearly 7 million people are now internally displaced within the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to ongoing conflict and escalating violence. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) warned that the DRC is facing one of the world’s biggest displacement and humanitarian crises. Only $37 million has been received of the $100 million sought by the IOM for its DRC operations. Fighting between M23 rebels and factions loyal to the DRC’s government has intensified in the eastern province of North Kivu since early October. Sudan talks. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took control of an airport in the state of West Kordofan and an army base in Central Darfur as cease-fire talks with the Sudanese military resumed last weekend in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The talks are being mediated by the United States, Saudi Arabia, the African Union, and the East African bloc Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which includes Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda as members. Experts don’t see an end to fighting through the talks. Negotiations are focused on securing a new temporary cease-fire and access to humanitarian aid. Previous talks were abandoned four months ago after the warring sides violated multiple cease-fire agreements. Last week, the RSF seized control of Sudan’s second-largest city, Nyala, after months of fighting with the army. The power struggle has killed up to 9,000 people and displaced some 5.4 million more. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a public holiday to take place on Dec. 15, after the country’s team won the Rugby World Cup. It is a record fourth title for the Springboks, who defeated New Zealand by one point, 12-11, on Saturday in Paris. Ramaphosa hailed the win as a chance to unify a country facing economic challenges and power outages. Despite rugby’s contentious history in South Africa as a symbol of white privilege during the apartheid era, the Springboks have since transformed into a multiracial team. In 2018, Siya Kolisi became the team’s first-ever Black captain, and Saturday’s win is his second time leading the team to victory, having hoisted the Webb Ellis Cup four years ago in Japan. Reporting Gaza voices. In Tunisian outlet Inkyfada, Haïfa Mzalouat and Emna Chebaane report on the difficulties faced by local journalists in Gaza to report on the war, including limited access to social media. At least 14 local journalists have been killed in airstrikes, while those in the West Bank recounted settler intimidation. “We’re constantly feeling the tension,” Yasmine Asaad, a journalist for Asharq News, told Inkyfada. Baaba Maal’s Dakar. Baaba Maal has been a significant voice in African music since the late 1980s, but he is best known overseas for contributing to the soundtracks behind the Black Panther movies. I interviewed Maal many years ago, before Black Panther. At the time, the Senegalese singer was especially passionate about how the African diaspora had become cultural custodians of Africa’s traditional music and global image. In a recent New York Times article, Maal discusses with Abbie Kozolchyk the charm of Senegal’s capital, Dakar—including the country’s national theater inaugurated in 1965 by Senegal’s first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, and the recently restored Art Nouveau rail station home to Dakar’s new $1 billion rail line.

Photo / 123RF WARNING: This article discusses family violence and may be distressing. A young man who repeatedly beat his friend with a skateboard as he dropped to the floor claimed he was in “grave danger” and acted in self-defence. Jaden De Malmanche was also violent towards his 16-year-old girlfriend, at once stage beating her while she was pregnant and telling her he would give her a “homemade abortion” before punching her in the stomach. De Malmanche, 23, appeared at the Christchurch District Court for sentencing on a raft of charges, including family violence against his then-pregnant partner and robbing a dairy. According to the summary of facts, De Malmanche, who was 18 at the time he entered a relationship with his former girlfriend, became angry after she fell pregnant with his child in 2020. She later had a miscarriage. Judge Gilbert said while there was no evidence in front of him to suggest the miscarriage occurred because of De Malmanche’s violence towards the woman, he acknowledged that “that might have been the case”. From May to June 2020, De Malmanche subjected the woman to multiple attacks in a hotel room, a holiday park and on the street. De Malmanche kicked, pushed and smacked the woman, including pulling both her arms back, making her think they would be ripped from her shoulder sockets. During one incident, De Malmanche told the woman he was going to give her a “homemade abortion” and punched her in the mouth, ribs and stomach. About a month later, he attacked her without provocation, causing her to walk out of the address they were out and on to the street. De Malmanche followed her and pushed her with such force that her head hit the concrete ground, causing her to become dizzy and semi-conscious. He continued to attack her as she was stuck between him and a fence, only stopping when a member of the public intervened. On July 11, 2020 at 8.25am, De Malmanche entered a dairy that had just opened. He walked behind the counter and demanded the dairy worker hand over money and cigarettes, pointing a knife at her. He stole $100 from the cash register and $1300 worth of tobacco. On September 14, 2021, a day before De Malmanche’s 20th birthday, he was at an address in Christchurch with Matariki Ellery, a prolific fraudster with more than 170 convictions. The pair had smoked synthetic cannabis that day. Ellery said he doesn’t remember what happened before he was struck in the head with the skateboard. De Malmanche said Ellery lunged at him, so he hit Ellery on the head with the skateboard a couple of times with a level of force he described as no more than “four out of 10”. De Malmanche said the argument continued so, fearing for his own safety, he hit Ellery a third time with force, causing him to drop to the ground. He repeated this move, causing Ellery to drop to the ground again. He then walked out of the address and called emergency services, and could be heard apologising to Ellery on the phone call as he waited for police to arrive. Judge Tom Gilbert said he had seen photos of Ellery, stating he was in a “terrible state” and it “was not pretty viewing”. De Malmanche’s lawyer Abbie Hollingworth said her client believed he was in “grave danger” and was acting in self-defence when he struck Ellery with the skateboard. Hollingworth said De Malmanche had an “incredibly traumatic” upbringing, was neglected and exposed to drug use, which was relevant to his offending and addiction issues. She asked the judge to consider this when sentencing her client, as well as his age, stating he was between 18-20 during the offending. Judge Gilbert said the offending was very serious, but reports about De Malmanche’s background showed his upbringing was disadvantaged and sad. The judge acknowledged De Malmanche’s youth, his guilty pleas, his genuine remorse and his disadvantaged upbringing, which could be linked to some of his offending. He sentenced De Malmanche to three years and two months’ imprisonment. “I hope that when you do get released, you can come out and make something positive of your life,” Judge Gilbert said.

2023-11-01	03:27:27+00:00	Jacklyn Pellegrino	The music that&#8217;s all the rage right now	https://quchronicle.com/84107/arts-and-life/the-music-thats-all-the-rage-right-now/	On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a 1973 ruling that guaranteed women the right to an abortion. Last Tuesday tens of thousands women in Iceland refused to work, as a form of protest against the ever-persistent gender pay gap. In 2017, Russia decriminalized domestic violence, unless it is so severe it results in a hospital stay. And I can keep going. It’s the 21st century and yet it’s like the years of fighting from the women who came before us didn’t happen. It’s a fact every woman is painfully aware of. Consciously or not, it’s ever present in the back of our minds. Years of gender roles did not allow women to express themselves in the same way men could. So they found their own little way through art. That’s where the term “feminine rage” comes in. It has been explained as an ancestral and inherited response to the struggles, oppressions and wrongdoings that women have been subjected to. It is not a new concept. It’s been here as long as we have. It was just in the background, ever persistent but brushed aside. Until Paris Paloma’s “labour” emerged through TikTok, unknowingly creating its own genre. With a powerful chorus and even stronger bridge, “labour” garnered over 1.5 million streams in the first 24 hours of its release. The lyrics, “All day, every day, therapist, mother, maid / Nymph, then a virgin, nurse, then a servant / Just an appendage, live to attend him / So that he never lifts a finger / 24/7 baby machine / So he can live out his picket fence dreams / It’s not an act of love if you make her / You make me do too much labour,” combined with the background vocals of little children screaming the song, created an enormous emotional response — and it just picked up from there. Paloma’s other hit “the fruits” — which ironically came before “labour” and yet blew up after it — took a slightly more aggressive turn if you look closely at the lyrics. I could dissect every single line and write an entire article on that song alone. It has become an unofficial anthem for wronged women in the media via TikTok. While the first half of my favorite verse of “the fruits”: “Devil you call me / But seem to be enjoying / The fruits of my labour that came to me too young / When he stole my virtue / I’m glad it seems to serve you / That I was born a daughter not a son” is powerful on its own, it’s the latter half that is the most important. “Screaming birds sound an awful lot like singing / And I will tell you now / That I’m not even singing / There’s no escape for some.” In my opinion, this explains the entire phenomenon of the feminine rage music genre. These lyrics show that music can be more than a set of lyrics combined with a melody and rhythm behind them. Women are tired and angry. Do I really have to spell it out? And it is not just about the very obvious sexist laws and issues that are still persistent in our society. It’s about the tiny things, things that someone who wasn’t raised as a woman would not even stop to think twice about. Women have been expressing their frustrations for years, but it either went unnoticed or ridiculed. Just listen to Jennifer Lopez, Marina or Halsey, for example. Paloma’s angry lyrics seemed to have opened a damn, releasing new songs and suppressed emotions. You don’t have to listen to Paloma specifically to understand what I’m talking about. Ever yelled out loud the lyrics to Taylor Swift’s “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve?” If your answer is yes, you get it. Some feminine rage songs can get rather graphic. “Us and pigs” by Sofia Isella released in January of 2023 spells it out without sugarcoating anything. No metaphors, no blank spaces for you to fill. Only pure and unfiltered frustration. “In nine months, we’ll have a kid you won’t care about / And if the kids not straight, white and male / We guarantee a living hell / Murder in the name of a loving god / Our women are cattle, there’s blood on our kids / Are you being paid to not pay attention? / Does it have to happen to your mother, to your sister or your daughter / For you to take it personal?” And I’m just listing a few examples here. I could sit here and list all of them out, comb through every decade, every genre of music to give you so many more examples and we would be here forever. Isn’t that sad? Why is there still a need for this? You might think it’s just a reaction, just women releasing generations of repressed rage. It’s so much more though. Because no matter how much we scream, nothing really changes.

Photo / Nick Reed A police botch-up that derailed a murder trial has been looked into and the trial is set to be reheard. In late July, the police’s late disclosure of photos and notebooks led to a murder trial of three men in the High Court at Auckland being aborted. The police told RNZ on Wednesday they had since completed two reviews of the case. They aimed to ensure their disclosure processes and training provided “the platform for file managers to comply with all statutory requirements”. “The issues identified have been mitigated via Crown Law and the homicide trial is set to be reheard in the Auckland High Court early next year.” They weighed up what they did against disclosure guidelines laid out by a High Court Disclosure Working Group, but did not go into details. The Independent Police Conduct Authority had also been notified. The police said they were following up with a national review into how they handled the disclosure of evidence. Delays and problems around disclosing evidence have contributed to a logjam in the District Courts, where defence lawyers left uncertain around disclosure have been increasingly opting for jury trials - instead of more streamlined judge-only trials - to keep their defendants’ options open, according to police documents.
2023-10-31	21:47:29+00:00		Missouri appeals court rules against ballot summary language that described ‘dangerous’ abortions	https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/us-government/3255908/missouri-appeals-court-rules-against-ballot-summary-language-that-described-dangerous-abortions.html	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri appeals court ruled Tuesday against Republican-written summaries of abortion-rights ballot measures that described several proposed amendments as allowing “dangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.” A three-judge panel of the Western District Court of Appeals found the summaries written by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who is running for governor in 2024, are politically partisan. Ballot summaries are used on Missouri ballots to help voters understand sometimes lengthy and complex constitutional amendments and policy changes. Ashcroft’s original description of the amendments, which could go on the ballot in 2024 if supporters gather enough voter signatures, would have asked voters whether they want to “allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.” But the appeals-court panel wrote that allowing unrestricted abortion “during all nine months of pregnancy is not a probable effect of initiatives.” The judges largely upheld summaries that were rewritten by a lower court judge to be more impartial. The summaries approved by the appeals court would tell voters the amendments would “establish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” and “remove Missouri’s ban on abortion.” Ashcroft said he plans to appeal the ruling. “We stand by our language and believe it fairly and accurately reflects the scope and magnitude of each petition,” Ashcroft said in a statement. Abortion-rights proponents lauded the Tuesday ruling. “Today, the courts upheld Missourians’ constitutional right to direct democracy over the self-serving attacks of politicians desperately seeking to climb the political ladder,” the ACLU of Missouri said in a statement. It called the decision “a complete rebuke of the combined efforts from the Attorney General and Secretary of State to interfere and deny Missourian’s their right to initiative process.” Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office is defending Ashcroft’s summary language in court. “Missourians deserve meaningful access to abortion and the ability to fully participate in the democratic process,” Emily Wales, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood’s Great Plains affiliate, said in a statement. “The court rightfully struck down language that is misleading and stigmatizing.” Missouri is among several states, including Ohio, where abortion opponents are fighting efforts to ensure or restore access to the procedure following the fall of Roe v. Wade last year. A measure to ensure abortion access is on the November ballot in Ohio after withstanding legal challenges from opponents. That state’s voters in August rejected a measure that would have required at least 60% of the vote to amend the state constitution, an approach supported by abortion opponents that would have made it harder to adopt the November ballot question. Measures to protect access already have spots in the 2024 votes in Maryland and New York. Legislative efforts or petition drives are underway in a variety of states. There are efforts to protect or expand access in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and South Dakota; and to restrict it in Iowa, Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Drives are on for both kinds of measures in Colorado. Voters in every state with an abortion-related ballot measure since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, effectively making abortion access a state-by-state question, have favored the side supported by abortion rights supporters. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll earlier this year found that most voters — including those in states with bans on access at all stages of pregnancy — want abortion to be legal early in pregnancy. Most voters also favored some limits. Associated Press writer Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas and Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

General Eric Smith suffered landed in the hospital Sunday following "an apparent heart attack," Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) alleged U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville's (R-Alabama) military promotions hold may have contributed, Politico reports. Politico notes the Alabama senator "has maintained the blockade over the Pentagon's abortion travel policy, ensnaring more than 300 generals and admirals at the upper rungs of the armed forces." Reed told the news outlet, "One of the reasons, I think contributed to his condition was he was doing two jobs at once. I've read where he was working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. As a result, if he had, as is normal, an assistant, he could switch off." POLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again? Per the report, he added that "Smith's medical emergency underscored, 'the fallacy and the danger' of Tuberville’s (R-Ala.) tactic of delaying top military nominees from being confirmed." Senate Armed Services member Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), according to Politico, "said Tuesday he would, in the wake of Smith’s hospitalization, push his colleagues even more vigorously to break Tuberville's logjam. He also pointed to nine open positions at Central Command, where there have been attacks on U.S. troops by forces supported by Iran." He emphasized, "I am so angry as much as I am saddened that the Marine Corps will be handicapped by the absence of a commandant, potentially. The potential as well for an absence in the commandant position just reemphasizes how the Tuberville hold is a desperate threat to our national security." Additionally, Senate Armed Services member Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) said, "We're talking about … that we have a commandant who’s in the hospital, and we don't have a vice commandant, so the Marine Corps essentially doesn’t have any leadership. I mean, when was the last time that happened?" Politico's full report is available at this link.
2023-10-31	20:10:45+00:00	Ana Faguy	Tuberville Reportedly Wants Senate To Confirm Marines’ Second-In-Command After Medical Emergency—Despite Holding Up Hundreds Of Nominations	https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/10/31/tuberville-reportedly-wants-senate-to-confirm-marines-second-in-command-after-medical-emergency-despite-holding-up-hundreds-of-nominations/	Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) is pushing the Senate to quickly confirm the second-in-command appointee to the U.S. Marine Corps, after the Marines’ top official collapsed over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday—a reversal for Tuberville, who has held up hundreds of military promotions this year because of the Pentagon’s abortion policy. Tuberville has been blocking hundreds of military promotions this year because of a Pentagon ... [+] abortion policy. Tuberville is urging fellow senators to confirm Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in July, to be second-in-command at the Marine Corps, the Journal reported, citing an unnamed Senate aide. The Alabama senator is circulating a petition that would require the support of 16 senators to push the Senate to consider Mahoney’s nomination, according to the Journal. Tuberville’s office did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. Over the weekend, U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith suffered a medical emergency and was hospitalized, the Marine Corps said in a press release. Because Mahoney’s appointment has not yet been confirmed, the next most senior office in the Marine Corps headquarters is filling in for Smith. Since the medical emergency on Sunday, the Marine Corps has not provided an update on Smith’s condition. It’s unclear how much support Tuberville’s reported petition has among his fellow senators, many of whom have urged him to stop holding up nominees. If Tuberville gets enough support for the petition, Mahoney could be confirmed by the Senate as early as Thursday, according to the Journal. Mahoney’s nomination is one of hundreds of military appointments currently held up. Tuberville’s objection surrounds a Pentagon policy that pays for members' travel expenses when they seek out-of-state abortions. For most of the year, Tuberville has blocked military nominations from being quickly approved, arguing the Pentagon policy misuses government funding. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) can still move the nominations forward through a slower process, but he has been hesitant in the past to confirm individual nominations as the Senate usually approves appointments in bulk and that would break with Senate tradition. Despite Schumer reluctance, last month, a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was approved using this mechanism, as were a number of other military leaders including Smith. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has also expressed concern over Tuberville’s holds, saying he doesn’t “support putting a hold on military nominations.” And Biden has called Tuberville’s move “irresponsible,” saying the senator is “jeopardizing U.S. security.” Naval Chief Retires — Leaving Navy, Army, And Marines Without Leadership Amid Tuberville's Abortion Protest (Forbes)

Wade in June 2022 and sent abortion back to the states, voters in reliably red Kansas and Kentucky have rejected ballot measures written to constitutionally prohibit abortion. Voters in the battleground state of Michigan enshrined access, as did solidly blue California and Vermont. When the issue has been put directly before voters, they have consistently rejected bans or expanded access in red and blue states alike. Ohio is another red state where the results of a citizen-initiated abortion amendment will be watched closely next week. In August, Ohioans decisively rejected an effort to raise the threshold for constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%. The vote was 57% against to 43% in favor. Although the August vote did not specifically mention abortion, the move was widely seen as an effort by pro-life forces to undercut the November initiative to amend the state’s constitution to enshrine abortion rights. Public polling on the proposed amendment has been sparse. An October poll by Baldwin Wallace University suggests that the November measure will pass by margin similar to the one that failed in August. The poll, using some language from the amendment, described the amendment this way: “Issue 1 is an amendment to the Ohio Constitution which would protect the right to reproductive freedom, including “access to contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion.” The amendment would also allow the state ‘to prohibit abortion after fetal viability, unless it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.’ If the election was held today, how would you vote on Issue 1?” Fifty-eight percent of likely voters who indicated that they were certain to vote said they would vote in favor, while 34% would not. Pro-life forces in Ohio have suggested the amendment is too broad and could compromise parental rights, a theme that has proved popular on issues such as school curricula in other states. They hope this new approach can sink the amendment. Popular Republican Governor Mike DeWine, who won reelection by 25 points last year, is calling the amendment too radical for Ohio. Pundits are also watching races in other states where abortion is playing a role. In Virginia, Governor Glenn Youngkin’s Republicans are trying to hold the lower house and flip the state Senate. Abortion ads are ubiquitous in the battleground districts. Republicans have embraced the idea of a 15-week ban with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which Youngkin believes is popular. The outcomes could provide new indications of the strength of the abortion issue at the ballot box and the Governor’s popularity. There is a familiar historical pattern in the support for the Ohio amendment. For decades, Americans have made clear that individuals should be able to make their own choices and that those choices should be respected. A question asked in 1973 by Louis Harris and Associates shortly after the Roe v. Wade decision was worded this way. “So long as a doctor has to be consulted, the matter of an abortion is only a question of a woman’s decision with her doctor’s professional advice.” The mention of a doctor’s consultation probably boosted the affirmative response, but still 68% tended to agree with the statement and only 23% tended to disagree. Poll questions that emphasize personal choice on abortion produce strong pro-choice responses. Surveys that frame other issues in terms of choice show the same pattern. A 1994 Time/CNN/Yankelovich Partners question found that 73% agreed with the statement “smoking may be a bad habit, but everyone should have the right to make his or her own choice about whether to smoke.” We saw the same impulse in questions about COVID. While Americans wanted to limit their exposure to those who refused vaccination, people still thought the decision should be up to the individual. Seventy-two percent in an Ipsos/USA Today poll agreed that “people have a right not to get the vaccine”. Questions about adults’ usage of pornography, about school choice, and even third party presidential candidates repeat this pattern. I don’t know how Ohio’s Issue 1 will turn out, but I do know that Americans value choice and want theirs respected.

District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram also blocked the state's 1997 law requiring women to wait 24 hours for an abortion after requesting one. The ruling follows a 2022 statewide vote in Kansas which affirmed support for abortion access under the state constitution. "The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue," Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. "Nevertheless, the State's capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights." Jayaram's order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of June 2024 for a lawsuit filed by abortion providers, against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions. The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions. This is why conservatives are so desperate to prevent votes on abortion access. They tend to lose them, and those votes can directly shape state constitutions. They are getting desperate in Ohio, next up, despite inconclusive polls.

A Kansas judge on Monday put a new state law on medication abortions on hold and blocked older restrictions that for years have spelled out what providers must tell patients and forced patients to wait 24 hours to end their pregnancies. The ruling was another big victory for abortion rights advocates in Kansas, where a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively confirmed protections for abortion access under the state constitution. District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram's order suspends some restrictions that have been in effect for years. The waiting period had been in place since 1997. "The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue," Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. "Nevertheless, the State’s capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights."

The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions. "Each day these restrictions were in effect, we have been forced to turn away patients for reasons that are medically wrong and ethically unjustifiable," said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates three Kansas clinics providing abortion services. The legal battle highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access a little more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion. In August, a judge in Texas ruled that the state's ban was too restrictive, and the Utah Supreme Court heard arguments on whether it should lift a hold on a state law there banning most abortions. "These kinds of informed consent laws reflect the long-standing will of the people of Kansas," Caleb Dalton, senior counsel for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is helping the state defend its anti-abortion laws, said in a statement. "Kansans are right to want to protect maternal health and safety and the lives of the unborn, and we will continue defending their interests." Kansas has been an outlier on abortion among states with Republican-controlled legislatures. The state Supreme Court declared in 2019 that the Kansas Constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy and therefore access to abortion as a "fundamental" right. GOP lawmakers proposed an amendment to the state constitution to declare that it doesn't grant a right to abortion — and in the August 2022 vote, that ballot initiative lost by a wide margin, upholding abortion rights. Jayaram concluded that the restrictions now on hold violate a patient's right to bodily autonomy. The judge also ruled that they violate doctors' free speech rights by giving doctors "no discretion" to omit any of the material mandated by the state. "In addition, there is no credible evidence that the mandatory delays imposed by the Act for arbitrary periods of time are likely to, in fact, improve either the consent/decision-making process by pregnant patients or conduct by the medical profession," the judge wrote. Republican lawmakers argued this year that "reasonable restrictions" are still fair game. A law that took effect July 1 required abortion providers to tell their patients that a medication abortion can be stopped using a regimen touted by anti-abortion groups. The state agreed not to enforce it until another ruling from Jayaram. In an August hearing, Jayaram said his reading of medical literature showed that the regimen's effectiveness is not confirmed by any valid studies. Major medical groups consider the regimen ineffective and potentially unsafe. Providers also attacked existing laws enacted by GOP lawmakers as a way to ensure patients are properly informed before undergoing an abortion. Patients not only must receive medical information 24 hours before the procedure, but that information must also be in writing and in a specific size and style of type. It must include statements drafted by abortion opponents about fetal development and purported abortion risks that major medical groups consider debunked, false or misleading. In his ruling, Jayaram said that abortion providers had provided "credible evidence" that much of the information that doctors are required to provide is medically inaccurate and "inconsistent with generally accepted science" for embryonic and fetal development. FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RESTRICTS ACCESS TO ABORTION PILL MIFEPRISTONE, DRUG REMAINS AVAILABLE Attorneys for the providers have argued that the growing layers of restrictions created a biased counseling scheme designed to discourage abortion. Kansas doesn't ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy. The providers also said challenging older restrictions became more compelling as other states banned abortion and out-of-state residents flooded them with requests for appointments. Kansas saw a 57% increase in abortions in 2022, according to state health department data. Alice Wang, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group representing providers, said in a statement that Jayaram's order removed "paternalistic barriers" to abortion access. "These restrictions are especially harmful now that Roe v. Wade was overturned, and Kansas clinics are overwhelmed with patients from neighboring states where abortion is banned," she added. Abortion opponents argued repeatedly before the August 2022 vote that without a change in the state constitution, all existing abortion restrictions could be at risk. The state Supreme Court is reviewing a 2015 law banning the most common second-trimester procedure and a 2011 law imposing tougher health and safety requirements only for abortion providers. Neither has been enforced because of the litigation. Attorneys for the state and the Alliance for Defending Freedom argue that in suing the state this year, providers are working against their patients' interest in having as much information as possible. Danielle Underwood, spokesperson for Kansans for Life, the state's most politically influential anti-abortion group, said Jayaram's decision left women seeking abortions more vulnerable. "This is a nightmare for women and a dream come true for the profit-driven abortion industry," she said in a statement. You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Republicans have opposed Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s measures to counteract state abortion restrictions implemented since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Supreme Court decision in June of 2022, including by paying travel expenses for women seeking abortions. The Pentagon argued abortion restrictions would harm military readiness and lethality, but Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi hammered Austin again for failing to provide data backing up that claim in a letter dated Oct. 27. “In other words, over a year after you stated unequivocally that the Dobbs ruling has ‘readiness, recruiting, and retention implications for the Force’ the Department of Defense is still searching for evidence to support this baseless claim,” Wicker, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote in the letter. (RELATED: Biden Pentagon Didn’t Need Congress’ Approval To Implement Abortion Travel Rule, Watchdog Says) On Oct. 24, DOD solicited public comments on a proposed study of service members to ascertain their family planning needs and response to DOD’s so-called “reproductive health” policies, according to a posting in the Federal Register. “There is little existing research on service members’ experiences with family planning,” the survey justification states. “This study will highlight areas related to family planning that may threaten the DoD’s ability to field a ready and lethal force,” it said. “It will also point to areas where DoD may need to augment or develop care, programs, services, or policies that provide needed reproductive health care and family planning services to the force in order to maintain and enhance health, readiness, retention, and lethality,” it continued. The Dobbs decision handed authority to make abortion laws to the states, finding that the Constitution never implied abortion as a right. A preexisting law called the Hyde Amendment bans federal funding for abortions in all but rare cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. In February, Austin issued three policies in February authorizing additional time off devoting federal funds to service members who must travel out of more restrictive abortion states receive elective abortions. He also set a timeline for service members to notify their superiors of pregnancy. Austin had expressed concern about military “readiness and resilience” in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in a statement. See my full hallway interview on the Department of Defense’s abortion travel regulations briefing here. pic.twitter.com/7Y9M7LfynC — Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) July 19, 2023 But, in March the Pentagon’s former head of personnel issues, said he did not know how many women have left the military or refused changes of station over state abortion laws. Gil Cisneros referenced “listening sessions” with servicemembers as well as a 2022 RAND Corporation analysis. The Pentagon’s plans to study service members’ response to the surveys and acknowledgment that little previous research has been done on the issue “completely undermines” arguments made by Austin and other senior defense officials about the abortion travel policy’s importance, Wicker said in the letter. Republicans have opposed the policies, with some arguing they are tantamount to taxpayer-funded elective abortions. “If the Administration were actually committed to maintaining an apolitical military, a study such as this should have been undertaken months before you promulgated this divisive and inflammatory policy,” Wicker said in the letter. A report on the travel policy’s cost and the number of service members who take advantage of it will be submitted in January 2024, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in an emailed statement in August. Twenty eight states have banned or restricted abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Wicker’s letter follows similar unanswered requests he made to the Pentagon for data on the policy sent in September.

In past years, students have protested over everything from LGBTQ+ rights to abortion access. But in many cases, these movements lack the intensity needed to bring about lasting change. That’s not to say that these movements don’t have an impact, however. Some protests, like the rallies held after the two tragic suicides that took place at Agnes Arnold Hall, attracted hundreds of students and received coverage from multiple major media outlets. But despite the initially impressive turnout, the push for more mental health support on campus seems to have completely stalled just a few months later. The organizers promised a broader movement including more protests, but lack of interest and somewhat unclear demands seem to have brought the fight to a screeching halt. The most the university managed in response was to put up fencing around Agnes Arnold and make some vague structural adjustments. It can be easy to pin the issue here on lack of specific demands, but even when students have complete clarity in what they’re asking for, results are not guaranteed. For example, consider the “UH Divest” movement, which asked the university to stop investing in companies that manufacture weapons. After an impressive social media campaign, multiple rallies and a push for the Student Government Association to discuss the issue, the organizers proudly declared a victory. They lauded the movement as an unprecedented success, but unfortunately, their “victory” was arguably meaningless in the long term. While the organizers were able to convince student government to vote against sending money to arms manufacturers, this did next to nothing in convincing the University administration to actually adjust where the school’s money went to. SGA resolutions are just that, after all: resolutions. SGA brought the issue before administration and the administration denied it, but the momentum died as if there had been some great victory achieved. Again, the accomplishments of these organizers is impressive and should be recognized, but if students don’t learn from past mistakes they’re likely to repeat them. Take for example the recent “Free UH” movement that’s formed to protest the closure of the LGBTQ+ Resource Center, among other issues. Despite a significant leafleting and social media campaign, the proposed “walkout” garnered no more than a few dozen attendees. Supposedly, a large number of students care about LGBTQ+ rights, graduate student pay and the other issues the movement rallied around. So why did so few show up? For a start, timeliness could be a factor. These protests took place over a month after the LGBTQ+ Resource Center closed, meaning that it was likely not in the forefront of most students’ minds. Media was also less likely to be interested in covering an issue that few readers would be interested in. But more than anything else, momentum matters when it comes to protest movements. All of these past movements stalled out because students stopped paying attention or organizers simply stopped organizing. The only real way to win lasting change is to continuously place pressure on campus administration. While the “Free UH” movement has some solid, concrete goals, they should be wary of making the same mistakes their predecessors did. A renewed push surrounding specific, newsworthy goals, combined with action that really pushes administration to take notice is the only path forward. It only takes a spark to get a fire started, after all. But if you want to keep the fire going, you have to keep turning up the heat.

Is that about to change? By the time Chasity Dunans learned about her pregnancy, she had already lost the right to end it. She had gotten her period in July, but towards the end of the month the 23-year-old mother of one started to have heartburn and wrenching stomach pains. She told herself: you’re not pregnant, you’re just sick. When the pain didn’t stop, she gave in and saw a doctor. “He was like, ‘Oh, yeah, you’re six, seven weeks pregnant,’” Dunans recalled. Then, she says, he added: “I don’t know what your guys’ plans are, but I do have to let you know that in Georgia, [if it’s] six weeks with a heartbeat, you cannot terminate the pregnancy here.” In the year since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, nearly all states in the US south, including Georgia, have banned almost all abortions. Only one southern state has not restricted abortion: Virginia. That’s why, on a recent Tuesday in October, Dunans and her boyfriend, Jayvonta Stone, drove eight hours from their home in Georgia to a house on a sleepy street in Charlottesville, Virginia. Other than the small sign out front and a couple of quiet protesters who lingered on the sidewalk, there was little to suggest that the house was home to an outpost of a national network of abortion clinics, Whole Woman’s Health. There, after waiting all day, Dunans was finally able to get an abortion, exactly 14 weeks into her pregnancy. “There are situations where some people are not ready, and why is it fair to bring a child into that situation? Some people, in the moment, have sex, and boom: ‘Oh, no, we’re pregnant,’” Dunans said, as she sipped tea a few minutes after her procedure. “That doesn’t mean it’s planned, doesn’t mean it’s wanted. It’s unexpected. So you should have that choice to determine how your life should go, especially if you cannot handle a child.” Virginia’s status as a haven of southern abortion access is at risk. On 7 November, the state will hold elections for the state legislature. Republicans, who already hold a majority in the house of delegates, need to win only a handful of seats to take control of the senate. Abortion is at the center of the election. Not only is it one of the top issues for voters, according to multiple polls, but Virginia’s governor, the Republican Glenn Youngkin, has made his support for a 15-week ban the centerpiece of his campaign to help Republicans retake the state legislature. Democrats and Republicans have spent the last decade trading control of both chambers of Virginia’s state legislature and the governor’s mansion, with Democrats winning all three in 2019 only to lose the house of delegates and the governorship just two years later. The November elections are set to be extremely close: a mid-October poll found that 42% of voters plan to support the local Democratic candidate, while 41% will support the Republican. If such a ban were to take effect in Virginia, many abortion clinics outside the state would likely feel the effects. In the year after Roe’s demise, the rate of abortions in Virginia surged. Clinics in the state performed, on average, roughly 550 more abortions each month compared with the months before Roe disintegrated, according to research from the Society of Family Planning. An abortion ban could force many of those patients to flee even farther north, to clinics that are already overwhelmed. Republican proponents of a 15-week ban argue that it’s a reasonable compromise on a contentious issue – the vast majority of US abortions take place in the first trimester of pregnancy. But abortion providers and their allies say they are increasingly seeing patients later on in pregnancy, due to the cascade of post-Roe restrictions that make it harder to get abortions quickly. People with low incomes, people of color and minors all are more likely to get abortions later in pregnancy. A 20-year-old woman who got an abortion at Whole Woman’s Health the same day as Dunans said that, although an abortion fund helped cover half the cost of her abortion, she and her partner struggled to pool the remaining $700. “I’m still at home and don’t feel like I could give the child the best life right now,” she said. The woman, who asked to speak anonymously, wants to go to college and get a real estate license. “I would always say if I did something stupid, I would have a baby, but now I’m at the point where I did something stupid,” the woman said, as she snacked on chocolate pudding and a Slim Jim while waiting for the procedure. “Well, not stupid. I had sex and I got pregnant.” The woman, who said she has identified as “pro-choice” all her life, wants to move out of her conservative hometown in Virginia, especially if the state restricts abortion. Right now, she can’t afford to leave. After Dunans and Stone discovered Dunans was pregnant, the couple took a few weeks to decide what to do. Having been together since they met on the school bus seven years ago, they are already parents to a one-year-old. They want to have a second child one day, but decided they just can’t afford another right now. Stone does maintenance; Dunans raises their child. “I don’t think I would be able to stay afloat with two children at this time,” Dunans said. Becoming a parent is exhausting, she continued: “It’s mentally draining. It’s emotionally draining. It’s physically draining. And there’s a lot of people who don’t have that strength to do so. So I’m always pro-choice. Your body, your choice.” Since Georgia bans abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy, Dunans booked an appointment at an abortion clinic in North Carolina for the first week of October. The drive took five hours and cost $80 in gas. Once she and Stone arrived, they learned Dunans was past 12 weeks of pregnancy. Due to a law enacted on 1 July, North Carolina clinics can’t perform abortions after that point. “My jaw dropped,” Dunans said. “We don’t have the luxury of wasting money like that, not in this time in our lives. So every penny counts. And to get that information – it was crushing.” After the 12-week ban took effect in North Carolina, abortions in the state plunged by more than 30%, according to recent research by the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion restrictions. On the day Dunans and Stone visited Whole Woman’s Health, about a week after their trip to North Carolina, 18 people showed up for abortions. At least two patients came from North Carolina – two from Georgia and one from West Virginia, according to a doctor who performed abortions that day. Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Due to the volume of patients that day, the doctors worked late into the evening, well past the clinic’s normal closing time. Because many patients had brought loved ones – their boyfriends, their mothers – to the appointment, the clinic was a full house. People waited in a converted living room, complete with fireplace and brochures for birth control, and listened to a soundtrack of relaxing muzak, waves and birdsong as doctors bustled around upstairs. Almost everybody was dressed for comfort, with many in sweats and Crocs. Few people spoke; several couples held hands and cuddled. One man appeared to fall asleep as he and his partner waited for her turn. The clinic’s purple walls were peppered with quotes from famous women and inspirational posters. “You got this,” one read. “Be your own hero,” another declared. One wall in a back room featured a quote attributed to Heather Heyer, the woman killed in the infamous 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. “If you are not outraged, you are not paying attention,” it read. Amy Hagstrom Miller, the CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, bought the clinic in 2017 from a retiring abortion provider, whose version of security was a back door that played the song Jingle Bells whenever someone walked in. Now, a receptionist keeps an eye on several cameras pointed at the clinic’s exterior – one of the few visible reminders that abortion, and the people who provide it, are under threat. A list of anti-abortion extremists, including their pictures, hangs in a back hallway, away from patients’ eyes. Currently, the clinic performs abortions up until 16 weeks of pregnancy. Hagstrom Miller wants to expand to 18 weeks by the end of the year and eventually go as late as 24 weeks. “More and more people are being pushed into the second trimester because they’re being denied abortion in Alabama or in Georgia or South Carolina or West Virginia or Tennessee, and so they have to figure out how to travel to another state and get childcare and get time off work,” she said. “It just pushes them further into the pregnancy – not because they’re just like sitting around, saying, ‘Oh, I’m gonna wait until the second trimester ’cause that sounds like a better kind of abortion.’ I think it’s cruel.” Avantae, who asked to be identified only by her first name, works as a patient advocate at Whole Woman’s Health, counseling patients as they navigate the process. She had an abortion when she was nearly 14 weeks into her pregnancy. She only realized she was pregnant at 13 weeks, when she was a single mother of one and, she said, “at a really unhealthy and low place”. If she had been unable to get an abortion, Avantae is not sure if she would still be alive. “Even the child that I had, who I love and adore, was not enough to keep me here,” Avantae said. “My abortion literally saved my life.” Most abortion patients in the United States are in their 20s, have already given birth at least once before, and have low incomes. Avantae talks to patients who don’t have phones, cars or computers; they have to scramble to take time off work, find childcare and scrape together hundreds of dollars to pay for an abortion. All of these problems can delay getting care. “Fifteen weeks, from start to finish, is a seemingly good amount of time, but in the scope of pregnancy and making this type of decision, it’s not enough time,” Avantae said. If Virginia outlaws abortion past 15 weeks or earlier, southern abortion seekers will likely stream into clinics closest to the Mason-Dixon line, in places like Maryland or Washington DC. Those clinics are already facing an increase in patients. Hagstrom Miller, well aware that the coming election may torpedo her plans to expand the kinds of abortions her clinic offers, doesn’t trust that Republicans would stop at a 15-week ban. She’s not alone. A September poll from Data for Progress, a progressive polling firm, found that more than half of likely Virginia voters in competitive districts have little trust in Republicans when it comes to their positions on abortion and reproductive healthcare. After all, the case that overturned Roe v Wade, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, technically turned on the constitutionality of a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. Since then, 16 states have banned almost all abortions. “They start with a 15-week ban,” Hagstrom Miller said. “And then they push to a six-week ban, and then they push to a total ban.” This article was amended on 31 October 2023 to correctly identify the lower chamber of Virginia’s legislature.

Mike Johnson holds political positions at odds with most Americans.	https://themoderatevoice.com/from-relative-unknown-to-wth-mike-johnson-holds-political-positions-at-odds-with-most-americans/	October 30, 2023 by KATHY GILL, associate editor Leave a Comment Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) is a junior member of the House, who came to Washington as a federal elected official concurrently with Trump, in January 2017. He served less than one term in the Louisiana House before running for Congress, having been elected in 2015 to fill an open seat. On a party-line vote (220-209), Johnson did what House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA), Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA) and Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) could not: secure enough votes to replace McCarthy as Speaker. His official positions illustrate that his political beliefs are an anathema to most Americans. Johnson supports a national abortion ban. Only about 1 in 10 Americans believe abortion should always be illegal. Johnson opposes same-sex marriage, which is the law of the land and supported by almost three-in-four Americans. He has “argued support for homosexuality could lead to support for pedophilia.” Johnson opposes no-fault divorce (first implemented in 1969). He supported the successful push by the “Louisiana Family Forum — the powerful association of conservative Christian pastors and congregations — and its national affiliate Family Research Council” to make it harder to obtain a divorce in Louisiana. In 2003, Stanford University researchers reported that states with no-fault divorce laws saw that “domestic violence dropped by a third in just 10 years, the number of husbands convicted of murdering their wives fell by 10 percent, and the number of women committing suicide declined between 11 and 19 percent.” Johnson blames abortion for school shootings. “When you break up the nuclear family, when you tell a generation of people that life has no value, no meaning, that it’s expendable, then you do wind up with school shooters.” In the U.S., most mass shooters are White and male. Johnson’s abortion comments are conservative code directed at Black women. In 2019, while serving as a member of Congress, Johnson and his wife ran a seminar series asserting the U.S. is a “Christian nation.” [The seminar was] organized by Onward Christian Education Services, Inc., a company owned by his wife, Kelly Johnson, a Christian counselor and anti-abortion activist.. The website for her counseling service — which was taken down shortly after Johnson became speaker — [stated the seminar] explor[ed] several questions, such as … “Can our heritage as a Christian nation be preserved?”… [I]n April 2019, Kelly Johnson proclaimed that “Biblical Christianity” is the only “valid worldview”… Mike Johnson referred to the Bible as the “owner’s manual” for “how things are supposed to operate” and called for “Biblically-sanctioned government” (emphasis added). The United States is not a Christian nation. See the First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances (emphasis added). This inconvenient fact has not dissuaded Johnson from asserting that the Constitution does not force a separation of church and state. Unfortunately, Pew Research revealed last year either (1) what a poor job our schools are doing in preparing students for citizenship or (2) the power of repetitive propaganda. Overall, six-in-ten U.S. adults – including nearly seven-in-ten Christians – say they believe the founders “originally intended” for the U.S. to be a Christian nation. And 45% of U.S. adults – including about six-in-ten Christians – say they think the country “should be” a Christian nation. A third [a clear minority] say the U.S. “is now” a Christian nation. Nevertheless, most Americans think that religion should butt out of politics. Where are the mainstream news stories that point the degree to which the new Speaker is out-of-step with most Americans?

2023-10-30	21:18:31+00:00		Kansas can’t enforce new abortion pills law or make patients wait 24 hours, judge rules	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-10-30/kansas-cant-enforce-new-law-on-abortion-pills-or-make-patients-wait-24-hours-judge-rules	A Kansas judge on Monday put a new state law on medication abortions on hold and blocked older restrictions that for years have spelled out what providers must tell patients and forced patients to wait 24 hours to end their pregnancies. The ruling was another big victory for abortion rights advocates in Kansas, where a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively confirmed protections for abortion access under the state constitution. District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram’s order suspends some restrictions that have been in effect for years. The waiting period had been in place since 1997. “The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue,” Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. “Nevertheless, the State’s capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights.” Jayaram’s order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of June 2024 for a lawsuit filed by abortion providers, against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions. The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions. Voters rejected a measure that would have let GOP lawmakers restrict or outlaw abortion. Can abortion rights activists replicate the win beyond Kansas? Aug. 4, 2022 The legal battle highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access a little more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion. In August, a judge in Texas ruled that the state’s ban was too restrictive, and the Utah Supreme Court heard arguments on whether it should lift a hold on a state law there banning most abortions. Kansas has been an outlier on abortion among states with Republican-controlled legislatures. The state Supreme Court declared in 2019 that the Kansas Constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy and therefore access to abortion as a “fundamental” right. GOP lawmakers proposed an amendment to the state constitution to declare that it doesn’t grant a right to abortion — and in the August 2022 vote, that ballot initiative lost by a wide margin, upholding abortion rights. Republican lawmakers nevertheless argued this year that “reasonable restrictions” are still fair game. A law that took effect July 1 required abortion providers to tell their patients that a medication abortion can be stopped using a regimen touted by antiabortion groups. The state agreed not to enforce it until another ruling from Jayaram. In an August hearing, Jayaram said his reading of medical literature showed that the regimen’s effectiveness is not confirmed by any valid studies. Major medical groups consider the regimen ineffective and potentially unsafe. The lawsuit alleges that Kansas has a ‘Biased Counseling Scheme’ meant to discourage patients from having abortions and to stigmatize those who do. June 20, 2023 Providers also attacked existing laws enacted by GOP lawmakers as a way to ensure patients are properly informed before undergoing an abortion. Patients not only must receive medical information 24 hours before the procedure, but that information must also be in writing and in a specific size and style of type. It must include statements drafted by abortion opponents about fetal development and purported abortion risks that major medical groups consider debunked, false or misleading. “I’m struggling to see why we’re singling out one specific provider type and one specific service,” Jayaram told the state’s attorneys from the bench during the recent hearing. Attorneys for the providers have argued that the growing layers of restrictions created a biased counseling scheme designed to discourage abortion. Kansas doesn’t ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy. The providers also said challenging older restrictions became more compelling as other states banned abortion and out-of-state residents flooded them with requests for appointments. Kansas saw a 57% increase in abortions in 2022, according to state health department data. Election officials say a decisive statewide vote in favor of abortion rights in Kansas has been confirmed with a partial hand recount. Aug. 22, 2022 “We feel compelled to get patients who are going to get back in the car for 15 hours medically accurate information because we know they’re scared to talk to providers at home,” Emily Wales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, told reporters after a recent court hearing. Abortion opponents argued repeatedly before the August 2022 vote that without a change in the state constitution, all existing abortion restrictions could be at risk. The state Supreme Court is reviewing a 2015 law banning the most common second-trimester procedure and a 2011 law imposing tougher health and safety requirements only for abortion providers. Neither has been enforced because of the litigation. Attorneys for the state and the antiabortion Alliance for Defending Freedom argue that in suing the state this year, providers are working against their patients’ interest in having as much information as possible. “Simply giving a woman information — just like these abortion providers have done for 26 years — that’s not impairing a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion one way or the other,” Denise Harle, an alliance attorney, said following the court hearing earlier this month.

2023-10-30	20:06:30+00:00		Doctors could revive bid to block Arizona ban on abortions performed due to genetic abnormality	https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/3255023/doctors-could-revive-bid-to-block-arizona-ban-on-abortions-performed-due-to-genetic-abnormality.html	PHOENIX (AP) — A federal appeals court has agreed to give abortion rights advocates a chance to revive their bid to block an Arizona law that makes it a felony for doctors to perform abortions on patients seeking the procedure solely because of a fetal genetic abnormality, such as Down syndrome. In an order issued Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to a lower court to consider the doctors’ request for a court order blocking the law. The appeals court didn’t rule on the merits of the challenge but concluded nonetheless that the doctors had legal standing to make the request. The three-judge panel said the doctors believe they would be targeted for prosecution, given that at least one of the state’s 15 county prosecutors intends to enforce the law, and that the doctors had shown they suffered economic losses by complying with the law. “Even if the regulations were crystal clear, plaintiffs would still lose revenue from the abortions that they can no longer provide,” the court wrote. The law makes it a felony punishable by four to 24 months behind bars for doctors to perform abortions if they know patients are seeking the procedure only because of a genetic abnormality in a fetus. U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes had blocked the ban in September 2021 in a lawsuit by the three obstetrician-gynecologists who perform abortions and a physicians’ association. He concluded the statute’s criminal provisions were likely unconstitutionally vague and said it was unclear at what point in the process doctors can be deemed to be aware that a fetal genetic abnormality exists. But the U.S. Supreme Court later threw out the order and sent the case back to Rayes, who had written his ruling before the nation’s highest court in June 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion. Rayes issued a new ruling in January, saying this time that the conduct the challengers claim to have been chilled from engaging in isn’t constitutionally protected anymore. The judge also said doctors don’t have a right to carry out elective abortions and their patients no longer have a right to receive them. The suit is being defended by Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen and House Speaker Ben Toma, both Republicans who won court approval to participate in the case. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat who took office in January, declined to defend the abortions statutes challenged by the lawsuit because she believes they are unconstitutional, attorneys for Mayes’ office have said in court records. Lawyers representing Petersen and Toma said the law protects people with disabilities from discriminatory abortions, and that the challengers lacked legal standing and hadn’t suffered harm from the law. Erin Hawley, vice president of the Center for Life and regulatory practice with Alliance Defending Freedom, which is defending the law in court on behalf of Petersen and Toma, said in a statement, “the abortion industry is using this case to push for and profit from abortions targeting children for their genetic makeup, physical appearance, and other inherent immutable traits.” It’s not yet known whether Petersen and Toma will appeal the court’s decision. Jessica Sklarsky, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the challengers, said in a statement that her clients deserve their day in court and that the harms from the law are clear. “We hope the district court will finally put an end to the climate of fear and confusion caused by this law,” Sklarsky said Attorneys for the challengers argue the law is vague over issues such as which fetal conditions are included and how doctors should assess a patient’s subjective motivations for seeking an abortion, leaving doctors guessing whether the law applies. In a separate case that examines whether doctors can be prosecuted for performing abortions, the Arizona Supreme Court is scheduled on Dec. 12 to hear arguments over a pre-statehood law that bans the procedure in nearly all cases. Earlier in the case, a lower court concluded abortion doctors can’t be prosecuted for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy because other Arizona laws passed since then allow the procedure. Arizona currently allows abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy under a 2022 law. A court blocked enforcement of the 1864 law shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. But after the Supreme Court overturned the decision, then-Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich succeeded in getting a state judge in Tucson to lift that court order. This past summer, abortion rights advocates began a push to ask Arizona voters to create a constitutional right to abortion. If proponents collect enough signatures, Arizona will become the latest state to put the question of reproductive rights directly to voters. The proposed constitutional amendment would guarantee abortion rights until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks of pregnancy. It also would allow later abortions to save the mother’s life or to protect her physical or mental health.

Wade decision in 1973. But after the Supreme Court overturned the decision, then-Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich succeeded in getting a state judge in Tucson to lift that court order. This past summer, abortion rights advocates began a push to ask Arizona voters to create a constitutional right to abortion. If proponents collect enough signatures, Arizona will become the latest state to put the question of reproductive rights directly to voters. The proposed constitutional amendment would guarantee abortion rights until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks of pregnancy. It also would allow later abortions to save the mother’s life or to protect her physical or mental health.

(Deposit Photos) Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services//October 30, 2023// Updates: Adds details about the court’s decision and quotes. A federal appeals court gave the go-ahead Monday for Arizona doctors to challenge a state law banning abortions sought because of fetal genetic defects. In a 23-page ruling the three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the doctors have legal standing because there is a “credible threat” they could end up being prosecuted for violating the 2021 law which they contend is unconstitutionally vague. Judge Ronald Gould acknowledged that Attorney General Kris Mayes has said she does not intend to enforce this — or, for that matter, pretty much any — abortion restriction. He said, though, there is at least one county attorney who has said he intends to enforce “restrictive abortion laws.” And this measure makes it a Class 6 felony, with a one-year prison term, to terminate a pregnancy if the woman is seeking the procedure solely because of a fetal genetic defect. But Gould noted that’s not the only threat to doctors. It also allows the father of an unborn child who is married to the mother to file a civil suit against them on behalf of that child for violations of the law, even if the mother gave the go-ahead. A similar right exists for a parent in the case of an unmarried mother. He said the law allows state regulatory agencies to revoke a doctor’s license. And the court also said the doctors already are suffering economic loses because they have to comply with the laws which forbid them from providing the medical services they would otherwise offer. Monday’s ruling does not resolve the issue of whether the law itself is constitutional. In fact, the court said it was not expressing any opinion on the merits of the claims. “We conclude only that the plaintiffs have standing to pursue them,” Gould wrote, something denied by a trial judge. Unless overturned, the decision paves the way for a trial, with the statute being defended by the anti-abortion Alliance Defending Freedom. “No child, born or unborn, should be discriminated against because of her race, sex, or disability,” said Erin Hawley, a vice president of the organization in a prepared statement. “Children diagnosed with Down syndrome and other conditions have the same right to live as everyone else.” She also took a slap at the economic loss argument presented by doctors. “The abortion industry is using this case to push for and profit from abortions targeting children for their genetic makeup, physical appearance, and other inherent immutable traits,” Hawley said. The 2021 measure was pushed by then-Sen. Nancy Barto. The Phoenix Republican argued that the bill would protect women. “What we’re doing here by not addressing this issue is we’re hurting the most vulnerable among us and making a judgment that they are unworthy to live,” she said. Proponents specifically said they were trying to keep abortions from being performed simply because a fetus was diagnosed with something like Down syndrome. Several doctors who perform abortions sued, along with the Arizona Medical Association and several groups that support abortion rights. U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Rayes initially blocked enforcement, citing the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade which said women have a constitutional right to abortion. He said the new law imposed an undue burden on women. But he reversed himself after the nation’s high court last year overturned that 1973 ruling. “Plaintiffs do not have a constitutional right to perform elective abortions and their patients no longer have the constitutional right to receive them,” Rayes wrote in dismissing their claims. That sent the case to the 9th Circuit. In reviving the case, the appellate judges do not address that question of whether women have a right to abortion. Instead, they focus solely on the law’s potential harm to the doctors. “They provide sophisticated testing and fetal screening for genetic conditions,” Gould wrote. “The physicians discuss the results of these tests with their patients and present options, including abortion.” He also said that prior to the 2021 law they “regularly performed abortions in cases where fetuses had confirmed genetic abnormalities.” In filing suit, the doctors said the law is vague — especially what is called the “reason regulation.” That is the part of the law that makes it a crime to terminate a pregnancy “knowing that the abortion is sought solely because of a genetic abnormality.” Their lawyers argued they are “over-complying” with the law because it is unclear what will get them into legal trouble. It starts with a concern that what conditions may constitute a “fetal abnormality.” Potentially more problematic, they said, it forces a doctor to assess what role that abnormality plays in a patient’s subjective decision to get an abortion. Even Rayes acknowledged these are not simple issues. “For example, patients sometimes report that they are terminating a pregnancy because they lack the financial, emotional, family or community support to raise a child with special and sometimes challenging needs,” he wrote. Then there’s the question of what knowledge a doctor must have about the patient’s motives. “At what point can a doctor be deemed to ‘know’ or ‘believe’ what is in the mind of a patient?” Rayes said. Gould said Monday the risk of being prosecuted and sent to prison in these situations gives the doctors standing to challenge the law. The case has been complicated by several factors. Mark Brnovich, who was the attorney general in 2021, had defended the law as constitutional. All that changed, however, when he was replaced in January by Mayes. She not only refused to argue for it but has said she will not bring charges against any doctor who violates this law. And Gov. Katie Hobbs issued an order — as yet untested — stripping individual county attorneys of their ability to prosecute such cases. That led to House Speaker Ben Toma, R-Peoria, and Senate President Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, intervening to defend the law. And the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing them, urged the appellate court to dismiss the case, saying all that means the doctors have shown no “credible threat” of being prosecuted. Gould, however, said that’s not the case. He pointed out that Mayes has said only she would advise county attorneys that prosecuting someone under this law would violate the Arizona Constitution. “The attorney general evidently believes that she lacks authority to bind county attorneys by her disavowal of enforcement,” Gould wrote. And he noted that Yavapai County Attorney Dennis McGrane filed a motion to intervene in that fight over the 15-week law, saying he wanted to “fill the void” created by Mayes. Then there’s the civil enforcement. “The Arizona Department of Health Services and the Arizona Medical Board — which have the power to penalize physicians and revoke their licenses — have indicated that they comply with the laws that are in effect,” Gould said. On top of that, he said, is the possibility of lawsuits by husbands or parents. All this comes as the Arizona Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in December about whether abortions are legal through the 15th week of pregnancy. Even if the justices conclude that right exists, this law, unless voided, likely still would deny that right in cases where the procedure is sought solely due to a fetal genetic defect. There also is an initiative drive to ask voters in 2024 to codify the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution. And the wording of that would trump restrictions like the ones in this statute.

2023-10-30	18:00:00+00:00		Ohio Quietly Purges 27,000 Voters From Rolls Ahead of Abortion Vote	https://jezebel.com/ohio-quietly-purges-27-000-voters-from-rolls-ahead-of-a-1850972175	In the latest example of Ohio Republicans showing they’ll do anything to thwart an abortion ballot measure, state officials canceled the registrations of nearly 27,000 inactive voters. On November 7, voting ends for Issue 1, which would amend the state constitution to enshrine the right to abortion. (The pro-choice position is to vote “yes.”) Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) ordered the purge of 26,666 voters in late September but didn’t announce the move. About 4,700 purged voters are from Franklin County, which includes the Democratic stronghold of Columbus. People who were purged can re-register to vote—but, importantly, not in time to vote on the ballot measure. The deadline for this election was October 10. LaRose is a strongly anti-abortion politician who is running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D). He was a vocal supporter of the failed campaign to raise the threshold for ballot measures, which he admitted was “100%” a strategy to try to stop the abortion referendum from passing. (That tactic failed.) Interestingly, he told county boards this summer to pause any purges before the August special election that could have kneecapped the abortion vote, but let them go ahead with cancelations now that Issue 1 only needs a simple majority to pass. So LaRose’s actions meant there were more voters available for the August election he supported than for the November election he opposes. He could have waited until after Election Day to do this—which he did after the 2022 midterms, but not this year. Huh! Ohio state Rep. Rose Sweeney (D) sent a letter to LaRose calling him out for his inconsistency. “This is a purge of choice,” Sweeney said. “The very least you can do is wait until after the election to do it. That is what your office did when you purged over 124,000 voters after the November 2022 election. You even stopped the purge before the August 2023 election, but now that our reproductive rights, our very lives, are on the November ballot, you have rushed to purge voters.” LaRose’s office said in response that Sweeney’s claims are “ridiculous” and said he was following federal law on inactive voters, but did not address the issue of timing or lack of transparency. Kayla Griffin from All Voting Is Local Ohio told the Ohio Capitol Journal that, in the past, the Secretary of State’s office has announced the cancelations, which allowed voting rights groups to try to contact people on the list so they can fix the issue. “Because of this lack of usual notification, groups like All Voting is Local and our partners could not inform voters they may have been purged and would need to register to vote again before the voter registration deadline that was just 12 days later,” Griffin said. It seems like Ohio Republicans really, really don’t want people to vote for this ballot measure. I think you know what to do in response.

While jaw-dropping stories such as an abortion she had while dating Justin Timberlake, and the horrors she experienced in a 13-year stringent conservatorship under the control of an abusive team led by her father Jamie Spears, have been making headlines, there’s an often overlooked yet vital aspect of Spears’ story. It’s the unparalleled amount of hard work, dedication, and heart she poured into her music that has made her one of the most iconic pop artists of all time. She sets up this narrative immediately in the prologue, recalling comforting childhood memories of walking alone through the woods in her native rural Louisiana, always ending the trip with a visit to her neighbor’s rock garden where she would lie down and look up at the sky thinking: “I can make my own way in life. I can make my dreams come true,” she writes on page one. “In the Bible, it says your sword is your tongue. My tongue and my sword were me singing,” she continues. “My whole childhood, I sang. I sang along with the car radio on the way to dance class. I sang when I was sad. To me, singing was spiritual.” For the young Spears, singing and music were an escape from the turbulent household she was raised in where her father was an alcoholic who was allegedly verbally and emotionally abusive, her parents often getting into screaming matches in the middle of the night. But music gave her a sense of power and control as a child living in a toxic environment. “Singing is magic. When I sing, I own who I am. I can communicate purely,” she observes. “Music stopped the noise, made me feel confident, and took me to a pure place of expressing myself exactly as I wanted to be seen and heard. Singing took me into the presence of the divine.” Music serving as a source of healing and power is a consistent theme throughout The Woman in Me. That connection to music was also fostered through immense hard work. Spears recalls how she was three years old when she did her first dance recital and four when she sang her first solo at a Christmas show at her mother’s daycare center. She soon won a talent contest in nearby Baton Rouge and competed on Star Search, coming in second place. Around the same time, she and her mother were making frequent trips to New York where Spears landed an understudy role in the off-Broadway play, Ruthless! that introduced her to the thrill of performing for an intimate audience. She eventually made it onto The Mickey Mouse Club, an experience she calls one of the most formative of her life. “Performing on that show ignited me,” she raves. “From then on I knew I wanted to do what I did there – singing and dancing.” She was soon put in touch with talent manager Larry Rudolph, who got her several auditions for record labels. “Larry took me around town, and I went into rooms full of executives and sang Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing.’ Gazing out at rooms full of men in suits looking me up and down in my small dress and high heels, I sang loud,” she asserts. Her audition earned a deal with Jive Records and she promptly went into the studio to record her first album, …Baby One More Time, with pop mastermind, Max Martin. “I worked for hours straight. My work ethic was strong. I would never come out,” she professes. “I would stay in the studio as long as I could. If anyone wanted to leave, I’d say, ‘I wasn’t perfect.’” Her passion for music and tireless work ethic carried her through even her most trying times, particularly when she recorded her 2007 album, Blackout. At this point, Spears had one infant son and was pregnant with her second, was under intense scrutiny from the media, and was mercilessly hounded by the paparazzi. One of the few places she felt safe was in the studio recording Blackout. “I always felt so happy and creative in the studio. Recording for Blackout, I felt so much freedom,” she shares. Noting how she got to “play” in the studio, she selected Danja as producer to give her a more EDM sound and affirmatively stated what she did and didn’t want for the album, coming into each recording session “focused” and “excited,” despite the chaos happening outside the studio walls. “The album was kind of a battle cry,” Spears proclaims. “Blackout was one of the easiest and most satisfying albums I ever made…I needed to have more self-worth and value than I was able to conjure back then. And yet, even though it was a very hard time in just about every other way, artistically it was great. Something about where I was in my head made me a better artist.” Music seemed to be the only source of freedom Spears had while living under the harsh reality of the conservatorship that ranged from controlling her diet to being sent to a facility against her will where she had to give blood weekly, couldn’t bathe in private, and was forced to take lithium, a drug that made her “lethargic,” among countless other frightening instances. Spears says that the conservatorship was “deadly” for her music and creativity and “crushed my soul.” But making her 2016 album Glory offered a reprieve from that. “I had a passion about it,” Spears remarks of Glory. “It was the only thing in the 13 years of the conservatorship that I really put my heart into. I worked hard on the songs, which gave me confidence.” She paints a picture of how the confidence she gained from writing and recording that album started to permeate across her life, particularly three years into her Las Vegas residency, Britney Spears: Piece of Me, started feeling more “passionate” about her performances. “As an artist, I didn’t feel able to reach the sense of freedom that I’d had before. And that’s what we have as artists – that freedom is who we are and what we do,” she professes. “Even though I might not have been doing my best onstage, there were pieces of me that began to awaken again. I was able to tap back into that connection between a performer and an audience.” Another important point that shines through in the latter half of the book is Spears’ connection to her fans. She says that she first learned of the #FreeBritney movement when she was locked in the rehab facility where a nurse showed her a video of fans chanting in the streets on her behalf, calling the video, “The most amazing thing I’d ever seen in my life.” “We have a connection, no matter where we are in space,” Spears remarks of her relationship with her devoted fans. “Even if you’re on the other side of the country or the world, on some level we’re bound together.” It’s clear by the end of the book that music is the lifeline between Spears and her fans, which she captures in the simple, yet powerful line: “What do we have except our connection to one another? And what stronger bond is there than music?” The Woman in Me is available now. Only members can comment. Become a member. Already a member? Log In.

2023-10-30	15:12:21+00:00	By Krista Kafer | Columnist for The Denver Post	Opinion: Here’s why a Colorado court sided with Catholic pregnancy centers on abortion reversal	https://www.denverpost.com/2023/10/30/colorado-abortion-reversal-court-ruling-senate-bill-190-injunction/	“The law at issue here runs afoul of … First Amendment principles,” U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Domenico wrote in this week’s decision. “Because it does, the State must come forward with a compelling interest of the highest order to maintain the law. It has not even attempted to do so.” Six months ago I predicted Senate Bill 23-190, which restricts constitutionally protected practice and speech, would be struck down. The law bans medical professionals from providing women abortion pill reversal care and prevents clinics and crisis pregnancy centers from informing women about their services. Domenico’s ruling is a temporary injunction against state enforcement of the law against plaintiffs and those acting in concert with them while the full case is being decided in federal court. For the reasons stated in Domenico’s 45-page decision, I now predict that the plaintiffs will ultimately prevail in asserting their rights to provide information and medical care to the women they serve. Until the passage of Senate Bill 190, a woman who had taken the first of two abortion pills, mifepristone, but not the second, misoprostol, could seek abortion pill reversal treatment if she changed her mind and wanted to continue her pregnancy. Mifepristone blocks progesterone from being absorbed causing the uterine lining that provides oxygen and nutrition to the baby to deteriorate. The second drug causes contractions and miscarriage. A dose of progesterone can block the effect of mifepristone. Progesterone is a natural hormone routinely prescribed for women at risk of miscarriage or early delivery, women experiencing infertility, and women on hormone replacement. I take it daily. Several studies show that taking progesterone after the first abortion pill in place of the second pill is twice as effective at preserving pregnancy than simply not taking the second pill and hoping for the best. In fact, the latter alternative poses a risk of health complications for the mother. Doctors and nurses at Bella Health and Wellness, a Catholic medical clinic providing OB-GYN care, pediatric care, and family primary care in Englewood, have successfully provided abortion pill reversal care for their patients. To preserve their right to continue to do so, the clinic sued the state in federal court after the bill became law. In granting the injunction, Judge Domenico ruled the law violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment in several ways. Bella Health provides abortion pill reversal care because the clinic “considers it a religious obligation to provide treatment for pregnant mothers and to protect unborn life if the mother seeks to stop or reverse an abortion.” The law discriminates against the clinic’s medical professionals when they act accordingly but “treats comparable secular activity [other off-label medical uses] more favorably.” Secondly, lawmakers made it known in hearings that they knew the law would have a disproportionately adverse impact on faith-based providers. Lastly, the law would not be applied broadly since pharmacy and nursing boards would review complaints on a case-by-case basis. The judge also barred the state from penalizing the clinic under the so-called consumer protection section of the law. The law unjustly targets medical clinics like Bella Health and crisis pregnancy centers which provide pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, information about fetal development, referrals, material support such as diapers and baby clothes, and other material and medical needs. Because such centers and clinics do not perform abortions, the majority in the legislature believes they should be forbidden to use terms like “comprehensive pregnancy care” in their advertising. This impinges on free speech. The Supreme Court and lower courts have struck down similar laws on First Amendment grounds. Domenico’s reasoning is sound and subsequent decisions will likewise affirm the rights of those who assist women facing an unplanned pregnancy including those who have changed their minds in the midst of a medication abortion.

2023-10-30	13:22:28+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/17108852506	Inside Mike Johnson's close ties to 'extreme Christians' who cheered J6	https://www.alternet.org/mike-johnson-2666097810/	After Rep. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) was confirmed as House speaker, countless pundits noted that he has a much different temperament from Rep. Jim Jordan — the Ohio Republican, far-right firebrand and speaker nominee who had lost three votes in a row. Jordan is flamboyant, theatrical, performative and in-your-face; Johnson, in contrast, is much more reserved. Yet from a policy standpoint, Jordan and Johnson aren't far apart. Johnson is a far-right Christian fundamentalist known for his-gay and anti-abortion views as well as his efforts to help former President Donald Trump stay in office despite losing the 2020 presidential election to now-President Joe Biden. In an article published by the conservative website The Bulwark on October 30, religious scholar Matthew D. Taylor emphasizes that Johnson's politeness doesn't make him any less extreme. POLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again? "Hot-off-the-presses profiles of Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, contain a seeming paradox," explains Taylor, a prominent figure at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies. "Some emphasize that he is a 'mild-mannered,' 'soft-spoken,' and temperamentally courteous individual. They similarly describe him as a 'Christian conservative' and a 'deeply evangelical Christian.' But many of the same profilers have also highlighted Johnson's troubling activity surrounding the 2020 election and Trump's attempt to overturn the American people's verdict. Johnson’s involvement was substantial enough that he has even been labeled the 'mastermind of the January 6 plot' and “a threat to democracy.'" Taylor continues, "So, which is he: an anti-democratic politician and an insurrectionist, or a mild-mannered Christian? Part of the problem is that we have come to imagine that a person cannot be both at the same time. Mike Johnson shows that you can." The religious scholar notes that he has "spent nearly three years researching the Christian theologies and Christian leaders that drove the January 6th insurrection," emphasizing that "many of them are mild-mannered, conservative, deeply evangelical." "There are principled, conservative Christians with heartfelt moral views on abortion, LGBTQ-rights, and a host of other cultural issues who value democracy and pluralism and recognize their preferred policies won't always win the day," Taylor argues. "Think Russell Moore and David French. And there are politically extreme conservative Christians who might hold the exact same views on the same issues as Moore and French, but who are also willing to upend democracy to see their agendas realized, which Moore and French simply are not." Taylor continues, "Politically extreme conservative Christians were some of the foremost leaders who bought into and bolstered Trump's 2020 election lies, who used theology to justify their own authoritarianism, and who have brought their extremist theologies into the heart of right-wing politics. Mike Johnson can be located in this group." Taylor goes on to point out that the "key Christian instigators of January 6th" who he has "tracked" are "part of an amorphous, nondenominational network called the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR)." "They believe and propagate extreme theologies that provide a mandate for Christians to take over society, and they have become increasingly influential in Republican politics in the past eight years," Taylor observes. "Several New Apostolic Reformation leaders — they usually call their leaders either apostles or prophets — were influential evangelical advisers to Donald Trump. Presumably, some of them still are." The religious scholar adds, "While he is not formally attached to the NAR movement, Mike Johnson, a Southern Baptist, has spent years hanging around with NAR leaders, looking to them as mentors and friends, and pursuing their agenda."

2023-10-30	11:00:00+00:00		Ohio measure on November ballot would codify abortion access in state constitution	https://catholicreview.org/ohio-measure-on-november-ballot-would-codify-abortion-access-in-state-constitution/	 October 30, 2023By Kate Scanlon OSV News Filed Under: Feature, News, Respect Life, World News Ohio voters will consider Issue 1 in November, a measure that would codify abortion access in the state’s constitution through fetal viability, typically understood to be 24 weeks gestation. The measure, advanced by the Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights and Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, will be on the state’s ballot Nov. 7. If passed, it would legalize abortion up to the point of fetal viability — the gestational maturity at which a baby may be capable of living outside the uterus — and beyond, if a physician decided an abortion was necessary for the sake of the mother’s life or health. Although Ohio lawmakers enacted a six-week abortion ban, that measure is tied up in state court, meaning abortions are currently legal in Ohio up to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Supporters of the measure argue it would return the state to the legal standard set prior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Opponents argue the measure would go further than that through its definition of fetal viability, which states viability would be determined on “a case-by-case basis.” Ohio voters rejected in August another ballot initiative that would have raised the threshold for passing constitutional amendments to 60 percent of voters, leaving in place the state’s requirement of 50 percent plus one vote. That measure would have made passing Issue 1 more difficult. An Oct. 17 Baldwin Wallace University Ohio Pulse Poll found that 58 percent of likely Ohio voters for the Nov. 7 election support passage of Issue 1. But Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, expressed optimism about blocking the amendment at the ballot box, telling reporters in an Oct. 25 press call that “we have a fighting chance to protect the unborn and serve mothers in ways that they deserve.” “If we lose that initiative, it means that there will be no ability for citizens of Ohio to speak to their own views and have them be reflected in the law,” she said. “There can be no consensus formed in the political process.” The effort will be “a tough battle” she said. “It is definitely not a slam dunk, but we’re fighting as hard as we can,” Dannenfelser said. On the same call, Stephen Billy, vice president of state affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, argued “we feel that there’s definitely a path to victory in Ohio, no doubt about it. We have an uphill fight from here to Election Day.” Billy said the group is seeking to “really contrast the extremism of the Democrats with the position of the Republicans,” and “that is what we’re trying to do in Ohio and in ballot initiatives going forward.” Kellie Copeland, executive director at Pro-Choice Ohio, told USA TODAY that people she knew who were pregnant or considering having children “talked to me about how they were afraid,” under the previous six-week ban. “They were afraid to be pregnant in Ohio because they were afraid if something went wrong, that their doctor wouldn’t be able to legally help them. And that just should never happen anywhere in the world, but especially a state like Ohio,” she said. In an Oct. 13 statement, the Ohio Catholic Conference pushed back on such claims, arguing that “over thirty Catholic hospitals, providing care to millions of patients in Ohio, affirm their commitment to delivering comprehensive healthcare for women and preborn children during pregnancy complications.” “Contrary to common misconception, neither Catholic religious directives nor any state law restrict Catholic hospitals from responding to pregnancy complications,” the statement said. “Catholic hospitals provide comprehensive miscarriage care, treatment for ectopic pregnancies, and perform other life-saving measures through medical procedures in life-threatening circumstances. Catholic hospitals play a critical role in maintaining public health,” it added. “Regardless of the passage or failure of Issue 1 in November, the care they provide during a miscarriage or other pregnancy complications will remain comprehensive and committed to the well-being of mothers and preborn children,” said the Ohio Catholic Conference, which is directed by the state’s Catholic bishops. “This commitment is an expression of respect for the dignity of all human beings and is central to their mission to carry out Jesus’s ministry of love and healing in the world today.”

The president said on X that a bill making this possible would be presented to his Cabinet by the end of this year so that “in 2024, the freedom of women to have an abortion will be irreversible.” Abortion in France was decriminalized under a 1975 law, but there is nothing in the constitution that would guarantee abortion rights. It was the rollback of abortion rights in the United States after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling last year and stripped women’s constitutional protections for abortion that propelled France on a path toward unconditionally guaranteeing such rights. Macron, honoring feminist Gisele Halimi in March, said he wanted to change the constitution in order “to enshrine the freedom of women to have an abortion, to solemnly ensure that nothing can stop or undo what will be irreversible.” Amending the constitution is a laborious process, but the government came up with a shortcut to avoid a referendum on the question. By presenting its own bill, rather than one originating among lawmakers, Macron can convene a special “congress” of both houses that must adopt the amendment by a three-fifths majority, something that appears doable. Such congresses meet at the Palace of Versailles. The text of the bill to reconcile all sides has been in the works for months. The president said that this coming week it would be sent to the Council of State, France's highest administrative body, a necessary step. It would then be presented to the Cabinet by year's end. Macron's office said that Article 34 of the constitution would be amended to include that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.” Anticipating the end of the process, the minister for equality for women and men, Berengere Couillard, said on X that “this is a victory for all women and a strong symbol sent to other countries of the world where our rights are losing ground.” Open an account online today, No annual fee required!

2023-10-29	20:24:51+00:00	WND News Services	Court orders 11-year-old girl to have abortion she doesn't want, didn't request	https://www.wnd.com/2023/10/court-orders-11-year-old-girl-abortion-doesnt-want-didnt-request/	[Editor's note: This story originally was published by Live Action News.] An 11-year-old girl in the United Kingdom will undergo a court-ordered abortion, even though she wants to keep her baby. The Telegraph reported that the girl became pregnant after being raped several times by older boys. London High Court judge Emma Arbuthnot ruled that she should have an abortion, saying it was in her “best interest,” even though it was a health board, and not the girl herself, who requested the abortion. “She became pregnant after being raped by a 14-year-old she met on the internet when she was aged 10, on the 18th or 21st of May 2023,” Arbuthnot said. “She was raped by another 14-year-old boy on the 11th of June 2023, but he did not make her pregnant.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Arbuthnot explained that a health board asked for “declarations that a termination of pregnancy would be in her best interests,” and that the placenta should be retained for forensic testing. However, according to both The Sun and Fox News, the girl (identified only as AZ) and her mother did not request an abortion. “When the many risks of continuing with the pregnancy were explained to her, AZ said she was ‘happy’ to be pregnant and wanted to continue with it,” Arbuthnot’s ruling said. “She said it made her feel ‘special’. The mother supported AZ’s position.” Yet a mental health expert said she lacked competence, — something Arbuthnot evidently agreed with. “Her views involved ‘naive magical thinking’ in her approach to the pregnancy,” she said. “She lacked the intellectual development and capacity to process the complexity of the decisions that had to be made and her emotional investment in one outcome was clearly clouding her judgement. An important factor in AZ’s decision-making was that the birth of a child would ensure she would not have to return to school.” Though it is undoubtedly clear that an 11-year-old does not have the ability to make such serious decisions, AZ’s mother was willing to support her daughter in her decision. Furthermore, if a child does not have the maturity to decide to keep a child, they don’t have the maturity to decide to kill one, either. Arbuthnot did not seem to weigh in on the emotional distress it might cause AZ to be forced into an abortion she does not want, when AZ is aware of her pregnancy and wants to have her baby. Even more disturbingly, the court wants to force AZ into birth control as well, but complained that there has not yet been a request for a long-term birth control implant to be placed. “The mother made the telling point to the social worker that there was a risk that if AZ’s pregnancy was terminated, she would just go out and become pregnant again,” Arbuthnot said. “For some reason the parents do not appear to be able to prevent this. The risks of another pregnancy are obvious but there is no application for a declaration that an implant should be inserted against AZ’s will. Instead, it is hoped that AZ may well agree to this.” Apparently, talk of bodily autonomy does not apply when a court chooses to end the life of an innocent child over his or her mother’s will, subjecting the mother — a survivor of rape — to yet another violation of her own body.

2023-10-29	20:13:33+00:00	WND News Services	Judge: Planned Parenthood must face trial in $1.8 billion fraud	https://www.wnd.com/2023/10/judge-planned-parenthood-must-face-trial-1-8-billion-fraud/	[Editor's note: This story originally was published by Live Action News.] A federal judge ruled on Monday that Planned Parenthood must stand trial for the $1.8 billion lawsuit brought by Texas that accuses the abortion organization of Medicaid fraud. Texas alleges that Planned Parenthood took Medicaid funds from the state and then failed to repay those funds after its status as a provider under Medicaid was terminated. Both Texas and Planned Parenthood had said they wanted a ruling from the court without a trial, but U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk decided not to rule on the case but to schedule a trial instead. It will begin in April. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Reuters reported that court documents which have since been sealed show that Kacsmaryk determined that Planned Parenthood should return some of the Medicaid funding to Texas as well as to Louisiana, though the state is not a part of the lawsuit. However, he did not say whether he thought Planned Parenthood had intentionally broken the law or how much it should repay to Texas. Texas was able to end Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood in 2021 and Louisana was able to do the same in 2022 following the 2015 release of undercover videos from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP). The CMP undercover videos, which Planned Parenthood has admitted were accurate, showed top executives from Planned Parenthood haggling over prices for the sale of body parts from preborn babies its abortionists had killed. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that based on the videos, which it deemed to be not fraudulent, Texas could defund Planned Parenthood. But Texas said that Planned Parenthood instead defrauded the state by continuing to bill and collect payments from Medicaid programs after the state had decided to terminate their contracts and then failing to repay the funding after courts ruled in the state’s favor. The trial will determine if Planned Parenthood knowingly committed Medicaid fraud and must repay the state.

He said on X, formerly Twitter, that a Bill making the move possible will be presented to his cabinet by the end of this year so that in 2024, “the freedom of women to have an abortion will be irreversible”. Abortion in France was decriminalised under a 1975 law, but there is nothing in the constitution that guarantees abortion rights. It was the rollback of abortion rights in the US after the Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling last year and stripped women’s constitutional protections for abortion that propelled France on a path towards unconditionally guaranteeing such rights. Fondé sur le travail des parlementaires et des associations, le projet de loi constitutionnelle sera envoyé au Conseil d'État cette semaine et présenté en Conseil des ministres d’ici la fin de l'année.En 2024, la liberté des femmes de recourir à l'IVG sera irréversible. https://t.co/4uSoIJu310 Honouring feminist Gisele Halimi in March, Macron said he wanted to change the constitution in order “to enshrine the freedom of women to have an abortion, to solemnly ensure that nothing can stop or undo what will be irreversible”. Amending the constitution is a laborious process, but the government came up with a shortcut to avoid a referendum on the question. By presenting its own Bill, rather than one originating among politicians, Macron can convene a special “congress” of both houses that must adopt the amendment by a three-fifths majority, something that appears doable. Such congresses meet at the Palace of Versailles. The text of the Bill to reconcile all sides has been in the works for months. The president said it will this week be sent to the Council of State, France’s highest administrative body, a necessary step. It will then be presented to the cabinet by the end of the year. Macron’s office said Article 34 of the constitution will be amended to include that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed”. Anticipating the end of the process, the minister for equality for women and men, Berangere Couillard, said on X: “This is a victory for all women and a strong symbol sent to other countries of the world where our rights are losing ground.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/macron-abortion-french-constitution-6210203-Oct2023/?embedpost=6210203&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/macron-abortion-french-constitution-6210203-Oct2023/?embedpost=6210203&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/macron-abortion-french-constitution-6210203-Oct2023/?embedpost=6210203&width=300&height=460" ></iframe>

2023-10-29	11:08:15+00:00	By Mike Wolcott | mwolcott@norcaldesigncenter.com | Chico Enterprise-Record	It begins with us — so let’s start anew | Editor’s notes	https://www.orovillemr.com/2023/10/29/it-begins-with-us-so-lets-start-anew-editors-notes/	Earlier in the week, we published what I thought was one of the very best “Editor For A Day” submissions we’ve received. It was written by Chico resident Lance Atkins, and the headline was “Civility — it begins with us.” I don’t often use space in this column to reprint the words of others — lord knows I’m long-winded enough all by myself — but on this day, I’m going to make an exception. First, Atkins wrote, “We certainly don’t have many adult conversations in the public square these days. Guest speakers at universities are shouted down, political opponents are routinely called racists and bigots, and immigrants are described generally as rapists and murderers.” And, “The vast majority of people in favor of more gun control are still OK with responsible gun owners. Your average pro-choice person is uncomfortable with late-term abortions.” It’s almost jarring to read such common-sense factual commentary these days, isn’t it? And finally, “It begins with us. Stop supporting the most divisive programs and people. Stop rewarding the most bombastic politicians. There is a silent majority composed of reasonable people on both sides of issues that agree we could do better if we quit assuming the worst in each other.” He’s exactly right. For all of the noise we hear every day from the people with the loudest megaphones, there remains a majority — yes, I said it, and I mean it — of people whose views are absolutely not represented by the stereotypical claims made of “the other side” in social media. Or even in the pages of this newspaper. I’m sick of it all. Aren’t you? From our little corner of the world, we’re taking another swing at elevating the level of discourse. We’ve made some changes to our letters to the editor policy, and those rules are announced in the editorial on today’s Opinion page. In a nutshell, we’re done printing letters in which liberals and conservatives launch mean-spirited salvos at one another. We’re especially tired of the “I demand to write a rebuttal to his rebuttal to my rebuttal to his rebuttal of my original letter about Trump” nonsense. We want timely letters on local issues and things that impact life on a local level. Period. Nobody is ever going to change the opinion of somebody else with a Facebook post (or mean-spirited letter to the editor) anyway; we can’t control the former, but we’re doubling down on our attempts to raise the bar on the latter. Of course, if you’re writing in response to something that was printed in our newspaper, that’s fair game. That doesn’t mean you can write a letter that says, “I read your story on Biden in today’s paper. Here are 226 words about how much I hate him and all of his supporters.” Respond to what was in the article or, especially, the specific impact on our lives at a local level. As noted in the editorial, directing insults at people you disagree with is generally a mighty poor way to get them to consider your points of view. With so many divisive topics in the news these days — and with politicians and rabid supporters determined to keep us divided by any means possible — how about we tone it down a bit and actually listen to other points of view? We’ve also heard, with growing frequency, that many readers are tired of reading “the same letters from the same people over and over.” Almost weekly, at least one person will tell me, “Before I read a letter, I look to see who wrote it. Half the time, I decide ‘I already know what they’re going to say’ and move on to the next one.” Thus, we’re cutting our generous “one letter every week” policy in half. From now on, it’s one letter every two weeks. Our hope is this will get some writers to mix up their topics a bit more — and hopefully entice more readers to send in letters as well. After all, the best way to avoid “running letters from the same people over and over” is to have more people write letters. These are big changes, and not everyone is going to like them. We get that. But, honestly — sometimes we need to pause and ask, “How’s that working out for everybody?” Mean-spirited free-for-alls in which both sides always insist on getting in the last word have moved beyond tiresome. They contribute to a toxic atmosphere that barely leaves the civil majority any space to breathe, much less speak. Lance Atkins said it best, so I’ll let him have the last word: “Rather than being resigned to gridlock and name calling, perhaps it’s time to speak up … in the most civil manner possible.” Mike Wolcott is editor of the Enterprise-Record.

There is a silent majority composed of reasonable people on both sides of issues that agree we could do better if we quit assuming the worst in each other.” He’s exactly right. For all of the noise we hear every day from the people with the loudest megaphones, there remains a majority — yes, I said it, and I mean it — of people whose views are absolutely not represented by the stereotypical claims made of “the other side” in social media. Or even in the pages of this newspaper. I’m sick of it all. Aren’t you? From our little corner of the world, we’re taking another swing at elevating the level of discourse. We’ve made some changes to our letters to the editor policy, and those rules are announced in the editorial on today’s Opinion page. In a nutshell, we’re done printing letters in which liberals and conservatives launch mean-spirited salvos at one another. We’re especially tired of the “I demand to write a rebuttal to his rebuttal to my rebuttal to his rebuttal of my original letter about Trump” nonsense. We want timely letters on local issues and things that impact life on a local level. Period. Nobody is ever going to change the opinion of somebody else with a Facebook post (or mean-spirited letter to the editor) anyway; we can’t control the former, but we’re doubling down on our attempts to raise the bar on the latter. Of course, if you’re writing in response to something that was printed in our newspaper, that’s fair game. That doesn’t mean you can write a letter that says, “I read your story on Biden in today’s paper. Here are 226 words about how much I hate him and all of his supporters.” Respond to what was in the article or, especially, the specific impact on our lives at a local level. As noted in the editorial, directing insults at people you disagree with is generally a mighty poor way to get them to consider your points of view. With so many divisive topics in the news these days — and with politicians and rabid supporters determined to keep us divided by any means possible — how about we tone it down a bit and actually listen to other points of view? We’ve also heard, with growing frequency, that many readers are tired of reading “the same letters from the same people over and over.” Almost weekly, at least one person will tell me, “Before I read a letter, I look to see who wrote it. Half the time, I decide ‘I already know what they’re going to say’ and move on to the next one.” Thus, we’re cutting our generous “one letter every week” policy in half. From now on, it’s one letter every two weeks. Our hope is this will get some writers to mix up their topics a bit more — and hopefully entice more readers to send in letters as well. After all, the best way to avoid “running letters from the same people over and over” is to have more people write letters. These are big changes, and not everyone is going to like them. We get that. But, honestly — sometimes we need to pause and ask, “How’s that working out for everybody?” Mean-spirited free-for-alls in which both sides always insist on getting in the last word have moved beyond tiresome. They contribute to a toxic atmosphere that barely leaves the civil majority any space to breathe, much less speak. Lance Atkins said it best, so I’ll let him have the last word: “Rather than being resigned to gridlock and name calling, perhaps it’s time to speak up … in the most civil manner possible.” Mike Wolcott is editor of the Enterprise-Record.

2023-10-29	10:05:00+00:00		France to make abortion rights 'irreversible' - Emmanuel Macron	https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/france-make-abortion-rights-irreversible-emmanuel-macron.1064232	French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday his government plans to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution to make them "irreversible". In an online post, Macron said a draft project would be submitted to the State Council, France's highest administrative court, this coming week, with a view to making abortion rights constitutional by the end of the year. "In 2024, the right of women to choose abortion will become irreversible," he said. The announcement follows a promise Macron made on March 8, International Women's Day, which was seen as a response to the overturning of federal abortion rights in the United States last year. Constitutional revision in France requires either a referendum or approval by at least three-fifths of the members of both chambers of parliament united in a congress. Most constitutional changes in post-war France have been approved by congressional vote. The termination of a pregnancy was decriminalised in France in 1975 and successive laws have since aimed at improving conditions for abortions, notably by protecting the health and anonymity of women, as well as reducing the financial burden of the procedure on women. A November 2022 opinion poll found that 89 percent of respondents were in favour of making abortion rights constitutional. According to government figures, 234,000 abortions were carried out in France last year. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

2023-10-28	19:14:59+00:00	Benjamin Hardy	UAMS abortion guidelines shaped by hospital’s fear of political retribution, former CEO says	https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2023/10/28/uams-abortion-guidelines-shaped-by-hospitals-fear-of-political-retribution-former-ceo-says	The Washington Post reports today on the tensions between doctors and hospital administrators in states with strict abortion bans, and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences comes out looking none too principled. Even the most fanatically anti-abortion states, such as Arkansas, have exceptions for life-threatening medical emergencies written into statute. But what exactly counts as an emergency is open to interpretation, and risk-averse administrators are often reluctant to provide doctors with concrete guidance. The stakes are high: Doctors could face criminal liability for performing an abortion illegally, while delaying an emergency abortion for a pregnant patient can be a matter of life or death. Horror stories abound of women with unviable pregnancies being forced by hospitals to wait to receive an abortion until the risk to their health increases. Then there are the political considerations for public institutions in red states. Stephen “Steppe” Mette, the former chief executive officer of UAMS Medical Center, told the Post that hospital leaders “opted for a narrow interpretation of the medical exception in Arkansas’s abortion law” when it weighed in on the issue after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade: The hospital issued June 2022 guidance that forbids abortions in certain cases, according to records, even though some hospitals in states with similar bans permit the procedure in identical situations. Stephen Mette, who was chief executive officer for the Arkansas hospital before stepping down in September 2022, said the staff made that decision because they feared retribution from the state’s antiabortion legislators. “You won’t find a document saying [it], but the leaders at UAMS were perennially afraid of funding cuts,” said Mette, adding that legislators routinely threatened to withdraw funding from the hospital. “I have no doubt it was subliminally or actually was overtly influencing the conservatism in the guidelines.” UAMS officials disputed Mette’s account. The attorney who crafted the guidance said she was “not influenced by any political pressure,” Leslie Taylor, a spokesperson for the hospital, wrote in an email. Mette now works as a senior advisor at BDC Advisors, a Miami-based health care consultancy, according to LinkedIn. Hospitals and doctor also have federal law to consider, which has long required hospitals to provide emergency medical care to anyone who needs it under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. The Biden administration is now suing Idaho because the state’s abortion ban — just as strictly worded as Arkansas’s, if not more so — doesn’t provide adequate room for doctors to perform emergency procedures. The federal government is also investigating hospitals in Missouri and Kansas and is “privately reviewing dozens of reports” of other potential violations of EMTALA, the Post reports. Might Arkansas hospitals be among them? Time will tell. But the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on the limits of EMTALA vis-à-vis state abortion bans; the Idaho case is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. And, the Post adds, the government’s willingness to invoke the federal emergency care law depends on who controls the White House beyond 2024. If a Republican wins the presidency, red states can expect an even freer hand to regulate abortion however they see fit. Are you tired of watered-down news and biased reporting?
